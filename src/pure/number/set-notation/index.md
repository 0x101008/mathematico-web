A *set* is a collection of things (usually numbers, but other things are possible).

Here is a set:
$$
A = \{ 1, 4, 5 \}
$$
The set $A$ contains three elements, and in this case those elements are the numbers $1, 4$ and $5$.

We're going to learn about the symbols $: \, , \, \cup \, , \, \cap$ and use them to work with sets.

Let
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & = \{ 1, 4, 5 \} \\
B & = \{ 4, -1, 0, 7 \} \\
C & = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n < 7 \}
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. Write down $A \cup B$

 1. Write down $B \cap C$ and $B \cap \mathbb{N}$

 1. Is $(A \cap B) \cup C = A \cap (B \cup C)$ ?
