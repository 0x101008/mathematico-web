The table below is called a *magic square* because, if you add together the numbers in any column, row or diagonal you get the same number.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\ \hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\ \hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

In this case, the number you get is $15$, and so we say that the *magic number* for this *magic square* is $15$.

The table below is a magic square of integers, but with some numbers missing. Can you find the magic number, and hence complete the magic square?

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
1 & & \\ \hline
 & 2 & \\ \hline
 & 4 & 3 \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

If you look at the only complete diagonal, you find that the magic number for this magic square is $6$. Can you find **integers** from $\mathbb{Z}$ to finish the magic square so that the sum of each row, column and diagonal is $6$?

The magic number is $6$. Look at the column with $?, 2, 4$. We would need $? + 2 + 4 = 6$, so what could be the missing number? [Note: $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ so this is allowed!]
