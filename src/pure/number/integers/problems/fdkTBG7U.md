You overhear a conversation.

 1. One person says
 > $10 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $3 \in \mathbb{N}$, and $10 - 3 = 7 \in \mathbb{N}$. In general, if $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $m - n \in \mathbb{N}$

 1. Another person says
 > Brilliant! Also, $0.8 \notin \mathbb{Z}$ and $0.7 \notin \mathbb{Z}$, and $0.8 + 0.7 = 1.5 \notin \mathbb{Z}$. Generally, if $a \notin \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \notin \mathbb{Z}$, then $a + b \notin \mathbb{Z}$.

Prove that they are both wrong.

We haven't spoken about how to prove things in mathematics yet, but that doesn't matter for this example - all you need to do to prove each person wrong is find a single example where the claim fails.
