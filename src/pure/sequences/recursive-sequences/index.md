We have already seen *explicit sequences*, where the terms are give by a formula. Sometimes, a sequence can be defined instead by doing some operation on the previous terms. So $u_{n+1}$ is given by doing something to $u_n.$ Such a sequence is called a **recursive sequence**.

In the next example, we will see how this works.

---

The sequence $u_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = 5 \\
u_{n+1} & = 2u_n + 1
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. Find $u_2, u_3$ and $u_4$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    u_{3} & = 4u_{1} + 3 \\
    u_{4} & = 4u_{2} + 3
    \end{aligned}
    $$

 1. Prove, in general, that
    $$
    u_{n+1} = 4u_{n-1} + 3
    $$
