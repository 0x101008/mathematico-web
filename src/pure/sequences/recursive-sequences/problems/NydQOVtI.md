The sequence $p_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
p_1 & = 1 \\
p_{n+1} & = k(p_n - n - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$
Given that $p_3 = -40,$ find the two possible values of the constant $k.$

Substitute $n = 1$ into the recursive formula to get
$$
p_2 = k(p_1 - 1 - 1)
$$
and simplify as much as possible.

Can you do similar for $p_3$?
