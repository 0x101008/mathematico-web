The sequence $u_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = 3 \\
u_{n+1} & = au_n + b
\end{aligned}
$$
Given that $u_2 = 1$ and $u_3 = 6,$ find the values of $a$ and $b.$

---

By the recursive formula given, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_2 & = au_1 + b \\
& = 3a + b
\end{aligned}
$$
Since the value of $u_2$ is given to us as $1,$ we can say that $3a + b = 1.$

Can you do something similar with $u_3$ to find another equation relating $a$ and $b$?

---

You will need to use simultaneous equations to solve for $a$ and $b.$
