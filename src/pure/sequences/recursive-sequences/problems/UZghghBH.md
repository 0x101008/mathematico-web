For each sequence, write down the first $5$ terms and hence, or otherwise, express the sequence using a recursive formula.

 1. $u_n = 5n + 3$

 1. $v_n = 9 - \frac{n}{2}$

 1. $p_n = 2^n$

 1. $q_n = n!$

 (Note: $n!$ is called '$n$ factorial' and is defined as
 $$
 n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
 $$
 so, for example, $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ and $1! = 1$
 )

After writing out the first $5$ terms, focus on what you need to do to the previous term to get to the next term each time.

For (a), notice that $13 = 8 + 5,$ and then $18 = 13 + 5,$ and so on.
