Let $u_n = n^2$ be an explicitly defined sequence.

 1. By considering $u_{n+1} - u_n,$ write $u_{n}$ in terms of a recursive formula.

 1. Hence, or otherwise, find the value of
    $$
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + 999 + 1001
    $$

---

Note that $u_{n+1} = (n+1)^2$

---

For (b), notice that
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_2 & = 1 + 3 \\
u_3 & = 1 + 3 + 5 \\
u_4 & = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 \\
& \vdots
\end{aligned}
$$
