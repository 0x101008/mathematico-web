A shape is produced by the following process:

 - A semicircle of radius $1$ is drawn.

 - A semicircle whose diameter lies along the radius of the first semicircle is removed.

 - A semicircle whose diameter lies along the radius of the second semicircle is replaced

 - A semicircle whose diameter lies along the radius of the third semicircle is removed

and so on.

The shape produced after $6$ steps is shown below:

If this process is repeated infinitely, what is the area of the resulting shape?
