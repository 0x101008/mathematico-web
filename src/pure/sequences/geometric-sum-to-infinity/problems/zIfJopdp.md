The second term of a geometric sequence is equal to $\frac{10}{3}.$

The sum to infinity of the terms in the sequence is equal to $15.$

Find the two possible values for the common ratio of the sequence.

---

You are given that
$$
u_2 = \frac{10}{3}
$$
and
$$
S_\infty = 15
$$
...

---

...so that
$$
ar^2 = \frac{10}{3}
$$
and
$$
\frac{a}{1-r} = 15
$$

Make $a$ the subject of the second equation and substitute it into the first.
