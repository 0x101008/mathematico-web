The infinite sum $S$ is defined as
$$
1 + (1 - x)^2 + (1 - x)^4 + (1 - x)^6 + \ldots
$$

 1. Find the range of $x$ for which $S$ converges.

 1. Show that $S$ be expressed in the form
    $$
    \frac{1}{q(x)}
    $$
    where $q(x)$ is a quadratic to be found.

For (a), note that the common ratio is $r = (1-x)^2$ and we must have $|r|<1$ for convergence to take place.

---

Again for (a), $|(1-x)^2|$ is simply equal to $(1-x)^2$, so we need to solve the inequality
$$
|r| < 1 \Leftrightarrow (1-x)^2 < 1
$$
This is a [quadratic inequality](/skills/pure/quadratics/quadratic-inequalities)

---

For (b), use the formula for $S_\infty$.
