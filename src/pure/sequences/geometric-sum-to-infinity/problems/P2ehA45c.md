The first three of an infinite sequence, $P_n,$ of squares is drawn below:

![](/img/learn/geometric-1.png)

The base of each square lies on the $x$ axis, and the upper-left vertex of each square lies on the line $y = \frac{x}{2}.$

You are given that $x_1 = 2.$

 1. Show that $x_{n+1} = \frac{2}{3} x_{n}$. Find $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ and give an explicit formula, in terms of $n,$ for $x_n.$

 1. Find the sum of the areas of the infinitely many squares $P_1, P_2, \ldots$
