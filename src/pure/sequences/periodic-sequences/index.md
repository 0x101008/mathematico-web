A sequence is periodic if it keeps repeating the same cycle over and over, for example
$$
1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 5, \ldots
$$
The **period** of this sequence is $3,$ because that is the length of the cycle.

For this sequence, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_4 & = u_1 \\
u_5 & = u_2 \\
u_6 & = u_3 \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
$$
In general
$$
u_{n+3} = u_n
$$

For any periodic sequence of period $k,$ we have
$$
u_{n+k} = u_n
$$

The periodic sequence $u_n$ begins
$$
2, \quad 1, \quad \frac{7}{2}, \quad 7, \ldots
$$
Given that the period of the sequence is $44$:

 1. Find $u_{29}$

 1. Find the sum of the first $29$ terms of the sequence.
