The periodic sequence $u_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = -2 \\
u_{n+1} & = \frac{u_n + 3}{p}
\end{aligned}
$$
Given that the period of the sequence is $2$, find the value of $p$.

---

Work out $u_2$ and $u_3$. Because the period is $2$, we know that $u_3 = u_1$.

---

You get two values for $p$, only one of them is valid (the other choice makes the sequence have period $1$).
