The sequence $u_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = 3 \\
u_{n+1} & = \frac{1}{u_{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. Show that the sequence is periodic and give its period.

 1. Find $u_{27}$

 1. Find
    $$
    u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_{300}
    $$

For part (c), group the terms together in a convenient way.

---

In the sum, $3 + \frac{1}{3}$ appears $150$ times.
