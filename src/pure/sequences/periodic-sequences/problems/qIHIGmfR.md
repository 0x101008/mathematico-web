The function $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = (x+2)(x-1)
$$

Find all possible values of $x$ such that the sequence defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = x \\
u_{n+1} & = f(u_{n})
\end{aligned}
$$
is periodic of period $2$.

---

We need $u_1 = u_3$, which implies
$$
f(f(x)) = x
$$

---

The equation
$$
f(f(x)) = x
$$
has $4$ solutions, but only two of these are valid.
