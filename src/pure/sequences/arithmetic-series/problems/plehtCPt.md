For a given arithmetic series $u_n,$ it is known that the $3^{\text{rd}}$ term is $2$ and the sum of the first thirty terms is $-1815.$

What is the $10^{\text{th}}$ term of this sequence?

---

Let $u_n = a + (n-1)d$ and $S_n = \frac{n}{2} \\left[2a + (n-1)d \\right]$.

You know $u_4$ and $S_{30}$ - this enables you to find $a$ and $d.$

---

Once you know $a$ and $d,$ you can find $u_{10}$ using the formula for the $n^{\text{th}}$ term.
