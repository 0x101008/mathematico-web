An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence that starts with a given number and then increases (or decreases) by the same amount each term. For example:
$$
5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \ldots
$$
starts with $5$ and then increases by $3$ each term. The starting number is usually labeled $a,$ so $a = 5$ for the sequence above. The amount that gets added each term is usually labeled $d$ and is called the *common difference*.

So, an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as
$$
a, \, a + d, \, a + 2d, \, a + 3d, \, \ldots
$$
We can see that
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = a \\
u_2 & = a + d \\
u_3 & = a + 2d \\
u_4 & = a + 3d \\
& \vdots
\end{aligned}
$$

The $n^{\text{th}}$ term can either be given as an explicit formula
$$
u_n = a + (n-1)d
$$
or a recursive formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = a \\
u_{n+1} & = u_n + d
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. The arithmetic sequence $u_n$ begins
    $$
    200, 194, 182, 176, \ldots
    $$
    Find the $20^{\text{th}}$ term in this sequence.

 1. The $5^{\text{th}}$ term of a different arithmetic sequence is $77.$

    The $25^{\text{th}}$ term is $-3.$

    Find the value of the $14^{\text{th}}$ term.
