An arithmetic sequence begins
$$
3k, \, 15, \, -k, \, \ldots 
$$

Find the first term in the sequence which is smaller than $-1000.$

You need to work towards finding an expression for the $n^{\text{th}}$ term, and to do that we need to find $k.$

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between the first and second term is equal to the difference between the second and third term...

... so $u_2 - u_1 = u_3 - u_2$ ...

... so $15 - 3k = -k - 15$
