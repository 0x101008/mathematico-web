Katya is trying to improve her running distance. She runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week.

On Monday of the first week, she runs $1.5\text{km}$, and she plans to increase her running distance by a fixed amount each time she runs.

On Wednesday of the second week, she runs $2.1\text{km}$.

On what day of the week will her running distance first exceed $10\text{km}$?
