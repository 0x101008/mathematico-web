The sequence $u_n$ is defined by
$$
u_n = n^3 - n
$$
Prove that every term in this sequence is divisible by $3.$

---

Fully factorise the expression for $u_n.$

---

The factors of $n$ turn out to be three consecutive integers.

---

If you have three consecutive integers, what must be true about exactly one of them?
