Let $u_n$ be defined by
$$
u_n = n^3 - 16n^2 + 72n - 88
$$

 1. Show that the second term in the sequence is the only term equal to $0.$

 1. How many terms in the sequence are negative?

$n = 2$ is a root of $u_n,$ so we can use the factor theorem.

Long division, the quadratic formula, sketch a cubic!
