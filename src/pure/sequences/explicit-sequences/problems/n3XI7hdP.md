A student claims that the sequence defined by
$$
u_n = n^2 + n + 41
$$
consists entirely of prime numbers.

 1. Verify that $u_1, u_2$ and $u_3$ are indeed prime.

 1. Find a counter-example which prove the student's claim is not correct in general.

---

An $n$ for which $u_n$ is not prime is printed on this page somewhere.
