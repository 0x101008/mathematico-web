Prove that every term in the sequence
$$
u_n = n^4 - 5n^2 + 4
$$
is divisible by $4.$

---

Factorise $u_n$ as much as possible.

---

Given any two consecutive integers, one of them must be even.

---

An alternative way to solve this problem is consider when $n$ is even and then when $n$ is odd (i.e. proof by exhaustion).
