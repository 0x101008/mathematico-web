The sequence defined by
$$
u_n = n^2 - 19n + 18
$$
contains a pair of consecutive terms which are equal. What is the value of these terms and where in the sequence do they appear?

---

If the $n^{\text{th}}$ term is $u_n,$ then the next term is $u_{n+1}.$ We are looking for a pair where
$$
u_n = u_{n+1}
$$

---

$$
u_{n+1} = (n+1)^2 - 19(n+1) + 18
$$
