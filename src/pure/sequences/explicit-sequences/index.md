Informally, a sequence is just a list of things. For example,
$$
10, \, 13, \, 16, \, 19, \, \ldots
$$
We tend to write the $n^{\text{th}}$ term using the notation $u_{n}.$ So, we can write:

 - $u_1 = 10$ is the $1^{\text{st}}$ term

 - $u_2 = 13$ is the $2^{\text{nd}}$ term

 - $u_3 = 16$ is the $3^{\text{rd}}$ term

and so on.

There is a definite pattern in the sequence $10, 13, 16, 19, \ldots$ We are adding $3$ each time. In fact, this sequence can be given by an **explicit formula:**
$$
u_n = 7 + 3n
$$
We can check, for example, that
$$
u_3 = 7 + 3(3) = 16
$$
To be precise, we could say that **a sequence is a function whose domain is the natural numbers,** $\mathbb{N}.$

A sequence is given by the formula
$$
u_n = n^2 - n + 2
$$

 1. Find the first $4$ terms in the sequence

 1. Where in the sequence does $44$ appear?

 1. Prove that $258$ does not appear in the sequence.
