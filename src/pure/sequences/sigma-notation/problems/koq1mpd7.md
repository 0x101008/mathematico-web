 1. Express
    $$
    \frac{1}{r(r+1)}
    $$
    in partial fractions.

 1. Hence, or otherwise, find the value of
    $$
    \sum_{r = 1}^{99} \frac{1}{r^2 + r}
    $$

For part (a), you need
$$
\frac{1}{r(r+1)} = \frac{A}{r} + \frac{B}{r+1}
$$

---

For part (b), write the function in partial fractions and then try working out $S_2$ and $S_3$. A lot of terms in the sum can cancel making it very easy to calculate.
