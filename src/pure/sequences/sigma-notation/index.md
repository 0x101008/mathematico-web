When we want to write a sum, it can be very inconvenient to have to write it out like so
$$
3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + \ldots + 17^2
$$
In these cases, we can use *sigma notation*:
$$
\sum_{k=3}^{17} k^2
$$
In sigma notation:

 - The $\sum$ is the Greek letter *sigma*, which is like *S* in the latin alphabet (for *S*um)

 - The $k = 3$ tells us where the sum should start

 - The $17$ at the top tells us where the sum should stop

 - The $k^2$ tells us the formula we're summing

Evaluate the following sums:

 1. $$
    \sum_{k=3}^{5} 3k - 1
    $$

 1. $$
    \sum_{k=-2}^{1} 2k - |k|
    $$

 1. $$
    \sum_{r = 1}^{3} \frac{(-1)^r}{r}
    $$
