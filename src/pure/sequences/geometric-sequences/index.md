Here is an example of what we call a *geometric sequence*:
$$
3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, \ldots
$$
As you can see, to get the next term we just multiply by $2.$ For this sequence, $2$ is called the **common ratio**.

More generally, a geometric sequence is a sequence of the form
$$
a, \, ar, \, ar^2, \, ar^3, \, \ldots
$$
where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

We can see that
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = a \\
u_2 & = ar \\
u_3 & = ar^2 \\
u_4 & = ar^3
\end{aligned}
$$
so that the $n^{\text{th}}$ term is given by the explicit formula
$$
u_n = ar^{n-1}
$$
or the recursive formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_1 & = a \\
u_{n+1} & = u_n r
\end{aligned}
$$

A geometric sequence begins
$$
2, \, \frac{14}{3}, \, \frac{98}{9}, \ldots
$$

 1. Find a formula for the $n^{\text{th}}$ term of the sequence.

 1. Find the $5^{\text{th}}$ term in the sequence.
