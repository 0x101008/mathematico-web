The lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle form a geometric sequence.

Find the two possible values for the common ratio of the sides.

---

Use Pythagoras' Theorem

---

Let the three sides be $a, ar, ar^2.$

The two cases to consider are when

 - $r > 1$ (so the sequence is increasing) and $ar^2$ is the hypotenuse (as it is the longest side)

 - $0 < r < 1$ and $a$ is the hypotenuse.
