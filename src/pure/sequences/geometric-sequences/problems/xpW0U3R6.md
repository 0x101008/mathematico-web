The interior angles of a triangle form a geometric sequence.

Given that one of the angles is equal to $60,$ use proof by exhaustion to show that the triangle is equilateral.

---

The three cases you need to check are when $60$ is the smallest angle, when $60$ is the largest angle, and when $60$ is the middle angle.
