A geometric sequence has first term $a \neq 0$ and common ratio $r$.

The sum of the first $4$ terms of the geometric sequence is equal to $0$.

Prove that $r = -1$ is the only possible value of $r$.

We have
$$
a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 = 0
$$
Dividing by $a$ gives
$$
1 + r + r^2 + r^3 = 0
$$
Since $r = -1$ is a root, we know $r+1$ is a factor.

---

Try using long division to divide $r^3 + r^2 + r + 1$ by $r+1$.
