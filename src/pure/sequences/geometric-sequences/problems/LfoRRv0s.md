The second term of a geometric sequence is $4.$ The fifth term is $\frac{4}{27}.$

Find $S_3$ for this sequence.

---

You are given
$$
\begin{aligned}
ar & = 4 \\
ar^4 & = \frac{4}{27}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Use
$$
\frac{ar^4}{ar}
$$
to find $r.$

---

Now you know $r,$ use
$$
ar = 4
$$
to find $a.$

---

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_3 & = u_1 + u_2 + u_3 \\
& = a + ar + ar^2
\end{aligned}
$$
