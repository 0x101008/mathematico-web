The sequence
$$
5, \, k, \, k + 3 \, \ldots
$$
is geometric and increasing.

Find the value of $k.$

There are several ways to solve this. Probably the simplest is to note that, in a geometric sequence, the common ratio means that
$$
\frac{u_2}{u_1} = \frac{u_3}{u_2}
$$

---

If you use the way from the hint, you find that you need to solve
$$
\frac{k}{5} = \frac{k+3}{k}
$$
