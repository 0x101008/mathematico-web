The interior angles of a triangle form a geometric sequence.

Given that the smallest angle in the triangle is $20^{\circ}$, find the size of the other two angles.

---

The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\circ}$

---

You have
$$
20 + 20r + 20r^2 = 180
$$
and $r > 1$ (because $20$ is the smallest angle).
