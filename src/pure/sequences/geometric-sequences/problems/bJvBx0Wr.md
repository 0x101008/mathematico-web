$$
a, \, 8, \, b, \, 100, \, \ldots
$$
is a geometric sequence where $r > 0$.

Find and simplify the exact values of $a$ and $b.$

---

You are given
$$
\begin{aligned}
ar & = 8 \\
ar^3 & = 100
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Use $\frac{ar^3}{ar}$ to find $r.$

---

Now you know $r,$ you can use
$$
ar = 8
$$
to find $a,$ and then
$b = ar^2$
to find $b.$
