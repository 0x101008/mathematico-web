Show that, for appropriately small $x,$
$$
\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \sqrt[3]{1 + x} \approx \frac{1}{x} + a + bx
$$
stating the values of $a$ and $b.$

First,
$$
\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \sqrt[3]{1 + x} = \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) \left(1 + x\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

The $\frac{1}{x}$ will combine with the $x^2$ term in the bracket to make an $x$ term, so you need to find the expansion up to $x^2$ before multiplying out and simplifying.
