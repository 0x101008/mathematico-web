By finding the first three terms in the expansion of
$$
(1 - x)^x
$$
show that
$$
(1 - x)^x \approx 1 - x^2
$$
and hence, find approximate solutions to the equation
$$
5(1 - x)^x = 4
$$

By the formula,
$$
(1 - x)^{\alpha} \approx 1 + \alpha(-x) + \frac{\alpha(\alpha -1 )}{2!}(-x)^2
$$
Now let $\alpha = x.$
