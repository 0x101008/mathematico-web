 1. Find the expansion of $\sqrt{1-x}$ up to, and including, the term in $x^3.$

 1. By substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into your expansion, show that
    $$
    \sqrt{2} \approx \frac{182}{128}
    $$

Once you get to
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{91}{128}
$$
try and rationalise the denominator of the left side.
