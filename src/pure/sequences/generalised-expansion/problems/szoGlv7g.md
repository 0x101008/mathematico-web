Find the first three terms in the expansion of
$$
\sqrt{x^2 + 4}
$$
and give the range of values of $x$ for which this expansion is valid.

---

$$
\left( 4 + x^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
and factor out the $4.$

---

The binomial expansion will still work if you have $\frac{x^2}{4}$ in place of $x$ in the formula.

---

The expansion is valid when
$$
\left| \frac{x^2}{4} \right| < 1
$$
This is a quadratic inequality, so sketch a parabola to solve it.
