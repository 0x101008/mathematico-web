The binomial expansion we have learned so far will not help us to expand
$$
\left( 1 + x \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
because $\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer. Fortunately, the binomial expansion formula can be generalised:
$$
(1 + x)^{\alpha} = 1 + \alpha x + \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{2!} x^2 + \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)}{3!} x^3 + \ldots
$$
This expansion could go on forever, and so we usually choose some term to stop at and just get an approximation.

The formula looks a bit unpleasant but it isn't so bad once you've seen some examples.

Find the expansion, up to and including the term in $x^3,$ of

 1. $$
    \sqrt{1 + x}
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{1}{1 - 2x}
    $$

 1. $$
    (4 + x)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{1+x}{2 - x}
    $$

Give the range of validity of the expansion in each case.
