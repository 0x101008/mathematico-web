Given a sequence $u_1, u_2, u_3, \ldots$ we define $S_n$ as
$$
S_n = u_1 + u_2 + \ldots + u_n
$$
$S_n$ is just the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence, and is known as the $n^{\text{th}}$ **partial sum**.

 1. Let $u_n = n^2 - 2n.$ Find $S_4$ for this sequence.

 1. Let
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    v_1 & = 16 \\
    v_{n+1} & = \frac{v_n}{2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    be a recursively defined sequence. Find $S_5$ for this sequence.
