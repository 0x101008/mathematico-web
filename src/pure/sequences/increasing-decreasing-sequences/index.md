The terms of an increasing sequence are getting larger and larger, so
$$
u_{n+1} > u_n
$$
whereas a decreasing sequence is getting smaller and smaller, so
$$
u_{n+1} < u_{n}
$$

If a sequence is increasing for all $n,$ we say it is an *increasing sequence* (similar for decreasing).

 1. Show that the sequence
    $$
    u_n = n^2 + 2n - 10
    $$
    is an increasing sequence.

 1. Determine whether the sequence defined by
    $$
    u_n = n^{2} - 10n + 4
    $$
    is an increasing sequence, a decreasing sequence, or neither.
