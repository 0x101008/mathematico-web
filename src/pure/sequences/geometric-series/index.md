It is natural to ask, what happens when we add together the terms in a geometric sequence? In other words, we want to find a formula for
$$
S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-1}
$$
The formula needed is:
$$
S_n = a \, \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}
$$
As with arithmetic series, you need to know the proof for this formula. The proof is discussed in the examples and you can have a go for yourself in the problems.

 1. Find the sum of the first $10$ terms of the geometric sequence which begins
    $$
    3, \, 6, \, 12, \, 24, \, \ldots
    $$

 1. Find the value of
    $$
    \sum_{k=3}^{12} 160 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{k}
    $$
