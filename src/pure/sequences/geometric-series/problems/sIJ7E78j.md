A geometric sequence is defined by
$$
u_n = ar^{n-1}
$$
Prove that the sum of the first $n$ terms is given by
$$
S = a \, \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}
$$

---

Let
$$
S = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1}
$$
and consider
$$
rS = ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1} + ar^{n}
$$

---

Think about
$$
S - rS
$$
