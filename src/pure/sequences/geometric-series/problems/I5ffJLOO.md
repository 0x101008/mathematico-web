A *Mersenne prime* is a prime number which can be expressed in the form $2^n - 1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For example, $7 = 2^3 - 1$ is a Mersenne prime.

A *perfect number* is a number which is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. For example, the proper divisors of $6$ are $1, 2$ and $3$; since $6 = 1 + 2 + 3$, $6$ is a perfect number.

Prove that, for any Mersenne prime $M$,
$$
1 + 2 + \ldots + M
$$
is a perfect number.
