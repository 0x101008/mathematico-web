Let
$$
f(x) = \sin(x)
$$
and
$$
g(x) = x^2
$$
Recall that we can compose these functions to make a new function
$$
f(g(x)) = \sin(x^2)
$$
Here is the curve
$$
y = f(g(x))
$$

How should we differentiate this function? We need something called the **chain rule**:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$
When you look at the chain rule, it isn't clear what you actually need to do. An alternative way to state the chain rule is
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}
$$
which, as we will see, makes it a little easier to use to begin with.

Differentiate the functions

 1. $$
    \sin(x^2)
    $$

 1. $$
    \ln(2x +1)
    $$

 1. $$
    (x^3 - 2x + 4)^7
    $$

 1. $$
    \sqrt{1 - e^x}
    $$
