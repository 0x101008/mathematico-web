Let
$$
S = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \ldots, \quad |r| < 1
$$

 1. By considering
    $$
    \frac{dS}{dr}
    $$
    find a formula for
    $$
    1 + 2r + 3r^2 + 4r^3 + \ldots
    $$

 1. Hence, find the value of
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k}{2^{k-1}}
    $$

For (a), remember that
$$
1 + r + r^2 + \ldots = \frac{1}{1-r}
$$

---

Again for (a), you can write this as
$$
1 + r + r^2 + \ldots = (1-r)^{-1}
$$
Differentiating the left side is easy; differentiating the right side needs the chain rule.

---

For (b), try writing out the first few terms of the sum and think about what value of $r$ in the formula you got from (a) would work this out for you.
