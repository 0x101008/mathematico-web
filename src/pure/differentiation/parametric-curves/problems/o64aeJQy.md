A curve has parametric equations
$$
x = e^{\lambda t}, \quad y = t e^{\mu t}
$$
where $\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ are constant.

Given that the gradient of the curve at the point where $t = 1$ is equal to
$$
\frac{11 e^5}{5}
$$

 1. Find the values of $\lambda$ and $\mu$

 1. Find and simplify a Cartesian equation for the curve
