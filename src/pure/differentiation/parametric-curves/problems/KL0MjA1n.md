The _Archimedean Spiral_ is given by the parametric equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = t \cos(t) \\
y & = t \sin(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Find the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the point where $t = \frac{\pi}{4}$, giving your answer in the form
$$
\frac{\lambda + \pi}{\lambda - \pi}, \quad \lambda \in \mathbb{N}
$$

Give the value of $\lambda$
