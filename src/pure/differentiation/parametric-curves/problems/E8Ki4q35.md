The curve $C$, which is a type of cardioid, is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = 2\cos t (1 - \cos t) \\
y & = 2 \sin t (1 - \cos t)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $0 \leq t < 2\pi$.

The cardioid intersects the $y$ axis at the points $P$ and $R$, and the $x$ axis at $S$.

The tangents to the cardioid at $P$ and $R$ intersect at the point $Q$.

Find the area of the quadrilateral $PQRS$.
