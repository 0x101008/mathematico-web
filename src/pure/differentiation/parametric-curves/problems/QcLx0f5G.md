The curve $C$ is defined parametrically by
$$
x = 1 + \sin(t), \quad y = \cos(2t), \quad -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq t \leq \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

 1. Find the gradient of the curve at the point where $y = -\frac{\pi}{4}$.

 1. Prove that $C$ is a parabola, giving its equation in Cartesian form.

For part (b), remember that
$$
\cos(2t) = 1 - 2\sin^2(t)
$$

---

Use the above hint with the fact that $\sin(t) = x - 1$ to get the Cartesian equation.

---

If the Cartesian equation of the parabola is
$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}
$$
give the value of $abc$.
