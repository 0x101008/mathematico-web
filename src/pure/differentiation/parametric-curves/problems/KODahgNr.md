A curve is given by the parametric equations
$$
x = \frac{t+2}{t+1}, \quad y = \frac{1}{t} - 1
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{t} \right)^2
    $$

 1. Show that, in Cartesian form, the equation can be given as
    $$
    y = \frac{ax + b}{2-x}
    $$
    where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ are constants to be determined.

For (a), you will need the quotient rule.

---

For (b), rearrange
$$
x = \frac{t+2}{t+1}
$$
to make $t$ the subject, and then substitute this into $y$.

---

Give the value of $10a + b$.
