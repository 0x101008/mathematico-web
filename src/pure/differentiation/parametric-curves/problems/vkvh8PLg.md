The curve $C$ is defined parametrically by
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = \sqrt{3} \cos(2t) + \sin(2t) \\
y & = t^2 - 4
\end{aligned}
$$
for $-\pi < t < \pi.$

The curve is bound by a rectangle whose sides lie tangent to $C$ and parallel to the axes.

Find the area of the rectangle.

Focus on finding the largest and smallest possible values of $y = t^2 - 4$. You might even find it most convenient to plot the curve $y = t^2 - 4$ with the horizontal axis as $t$ and the vertical axis as $y$.

The smallest value of $y$ tells you the lowest point on the curve, and the largest value of $y$ tells you the highest.

To find the leftmost and rightmost points on the curve, you need to find the largest and smallest values of $x$. You can use $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, or you can convert $x$ into harmonic form.

Give your answer to $3$ significant figures.
