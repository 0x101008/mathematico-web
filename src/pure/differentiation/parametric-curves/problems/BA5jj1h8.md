A violin manufacturer is designing a new violin, and a _Lituus_ curve is being used to model the neck.

The equations of the curve are
$$
x = \frac{\cos t}{\sqrt{t}}, \quad y = \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{t}}
$$
for $\frac{\pi}{60} \leq t \leq \frac{\pi}{6}$.

The manufacturer requires to know the $x$ coordinate of the point $B$, which is the intersection between the $x$ axis and the tangent to the curve at the point $A$, where $A$ has $x$-coordinate equal to $0$.

Find the exact $x$ coordinate of the point $B$.

The answer is of the form $\sqrt{n\pi}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Give the value of $n$.
