The curve below is given by the equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = \cot(t) \\
y & = \sin(t) + \cos(t)
\end{aligned}
$$
where
$$
\frac{\pi}{4} < |t| < \frac{3\pi}{4}
$$

 1. Prove that the tangents to the curve at the points $A$ and $B$ intersect at the point $C$

 1. Show that a Cartesian equation for the curve is
    $$
    y^2(x^2+1) = (x+1)^2
    $$
    and hence, using implicit differentiation, show that
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x(1-y^2)+1}{y(1+x^2)}
    $$

For (a), try not to make any assumptions. All we know is that $A,B$ have $x = 0$ and $C$ has $y = 0$.

Carefully find the equations of the tangents at $A$ and $B$ and then find their point of intersection. If this is equal to the point $C$, then you're finished.

For (b), try substituting $x$ and $y$ into the left hand side of
$$
y^2(x^2+1) = (x+1)^2
$$
and try to show that it becomes equal to the right hand side.

When doing the implicit differentiation, you will need the chain rule and the product rule.
