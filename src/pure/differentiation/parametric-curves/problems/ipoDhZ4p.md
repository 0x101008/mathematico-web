The curve $C$ is given by the equations
$$
x = 12\cos(t), \quad y = 5\sin(t), \quad -\pi \leq t < \pi
$$

The line $y = x$ intersects with $C$ at the point $P$, as shown on the diagram.

Express the equation of the tangent to $C$ at the point $P$ in the form
$$
ax + by + c = 0, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}
$$
where the greatest common divisor of $a,b,c$ is $1$.

Don't find $t$ - instead, notice that, at $P$, we have
$$
12 \cos(t) = 5 \sin(t)
$$
This allows you to find the exact values of $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ at $P$ (you could, for example, square both sides, or draw a triangle).

When finding the gradient at $P$, notice that
$$
12 \cos(t) = 5 \sin(t)
$$
at $P$, which allows you to find the _exact value_ of $\cot(t)$.

Give the value of $a + b + c$.
