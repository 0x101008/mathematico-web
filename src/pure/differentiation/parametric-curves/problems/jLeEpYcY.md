The curve $C$ is given by the equations
$$
x = 3\sec(t), \quad y = 4\tan(t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{ax}{by}
    $$
    for some $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$.

 1. Find a Cartesian equation for $C$.

For (b), try squaring $x$ and $y$. Recall that $1 + \tan^2(t) = \sec^2(t)$.

Give the value of $a + b$.
