A cardioid is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = 2\cos t (1 - \cos t) \\
y & = 2 \sin t (1 - \cos t)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $0 \leq t < 2\pi$.

The point $A$ is the rightmost point of the cardioid lying in the upper half of the plane. The point $B$ is the minimum point on the cardioid.

Find the exact length of the line segment $AB$.
