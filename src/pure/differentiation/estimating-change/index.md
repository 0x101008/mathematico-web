Consider the following question:

> A car travels $390$ meters in $30$ seconds.
>
> What is the velocity of the car in $\text{m s}^{-1}$?

You probably want to answer
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{velocity} & = \frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time}} \\
& = \frac{390}{30} \\
& = 13 \text{m s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
However, that gives us the *average velocity*. In actuality, the car might have been going faster than this for a few seconds, and slower than this for a few seconds, but it all balances out to give $390$ meters in $30$ seconds.

So, instead of asking "what is the velocity of the car?" we should really ask "what was the velocity of the car *at a particular instant* along its path?"

That is the question that differentiation can answer. Before we learn to do this, however, we'll learn how to estimate the answer.

A car is travelling in a straight line. Relative to a fixed origin, the position, in meters, of the car at time $t$ is modeled by the function
$$
f(t) = 0.5t^2 + 2t
$$

 1. The displacement of the car after $4$ seconds.

 1. Using an interval of width $0.1$ seconds, estimate the velocity of the car when $t = 4.$

 1. Explain how the estimate for the velocity of the car could be made more accurate.
