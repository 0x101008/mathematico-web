Let
$$
y = \frac{\ln(\cos x)}{\ln(\sin x)}
$$

 1. A student believes that
    $$
    y = \ln \left( \cot x \right)
    $$
    Explain why the student thinks this. Prove, by counterexample, that the student is not correct.

 1. Show that the gradient of the curve at the point where $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ can be written in simplest form as
    $$
    \frac{a}{\ln(b)}
    $$
    where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ are integers to be determined.

Give the value of
$$
10b + a
$$
