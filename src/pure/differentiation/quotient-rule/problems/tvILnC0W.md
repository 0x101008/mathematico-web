The function $g$ is defined by
$$
g(x) = 1 - \frac{4bx - 4b^2}{x^2 + bx - 2b^2}
$$
where $b \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ is a positive constant.

 1. Show that
    $$
    g(x) = \frac{x - 2b}{x + 2b}
    $$

 1. Prove $g$ is increasing for all values of $x$.

$x^2 + bx - 2b^2$ factorises

So does $x^2 + 4bx + 4b^2$
