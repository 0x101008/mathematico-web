Let
$$
f(x) = \frac{e^x}{\sqrt{2x+1}}, \quad x > - \frac{1}{2}
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    f'(x) = f(x) \frac{2x}{2x+1}
    $$

 1. Hence, show that
    $$
    f''(x) = 2f(x) \frac{2x^2+1}{(2x+1)^2}
    $$

 1. Hence, find the coordinates of, and determine the nature of, the turning point of the curve
    $$
    y = \frac{e^x}{\sqrt{2x+1}}
    $$

For (a), use the quotient rule, and then try to spot $f(x)$ within your answer.

When doing part (b), don't replace $f(x)$ with $\frac{e^x}{\sqrt{2x+1}}$. Rather, leave it as $f(x)$ and use the product rule so that you get
$$
f'(x) \times (\text{something}) + f(x) \times (\text{something else})
$$
You know $f'(x)$ from part (a)!

Let the turning point have coordinates $(p,q)$.

If it is a minimum, give $17(p+1)(q+1)$. If it is a maximum, give $19(p+1)(q+1)$.
