The curve $C$ is defined by
$$
y = \ln\left(\sqrt{\sin x - \cos x}\right), \quad \frac{\pi}{4} < x < \frac{5\pi}{4}
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{\sin 2x - 1}
    $$

 1. The point $P$ is the turning point of $C$. Find the coordinates of $P$, and determine whether this is a minimum or a maximum point.

For (b), you should use laws of logarithms first:
$$
\ln(\sqrt{u}) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(u)
$$

Use the second derivative test!

The coordinates of $P$ are of the form
$$
\left( \frac{a \pi}{b}, \, \frac{\ln(c)}{d} \right), \quad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}
$$
If $P$ is a minimum point, give $5abcd$. If $P$ is a maximum point, give $7abcd$.
