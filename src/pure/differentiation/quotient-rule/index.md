The last of the rules which will help us differentiate a variety of functions is the quotient rule. It allows us to differentiate quotients:
$$
y = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$
Here it is:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
$$
I remember this with the silly rhyme:

 > Low d high, minus high d low, draw the line and square below

where *low d high* means $g(x)f'(x)$ and *high d low* means $f(x)g'(x).$

As before, we'll get used to using this rule before proving it.

Differentiate

 1. $$
    y = \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1}
    $$

 1. $$
    y = \tan(x)
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{\cos(2x)}{xe^x}
    $$
