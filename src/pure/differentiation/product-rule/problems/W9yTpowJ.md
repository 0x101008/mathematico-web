Let
$$
f(x) = \frac{e^x}{x^n}, \quad x > 0, n \in \mathbb{N}
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    f'(x) = f(x)\left( 1 - \frac{n}{x} \right)
    $$
    and
    $$
    f''(x) = f(x)\left( 1 - \frac{2n}{x} + \frac{n(n+1)}{x^2} \right)
    $$

 1. Find the range of values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is increasing.

 1. Show that $f'(x)$ is increasing for all values of $x > 0.$

 1. Use the above work to explain why
    $$
    \frac{e^x}{x^n} \rightarrow \infty \, \text{ as } \, x \rightarrow \infty
    $$
    (This problem shows that exponential functions grow much more quickly than polynomials!)
