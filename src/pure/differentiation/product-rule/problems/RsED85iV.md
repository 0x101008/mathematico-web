Find the coordinates of, and determine the nature of, the turning point of the curve
$$
y = \ln(x^x)
$$

---

By laws of logarithms:
$$
y = x\ln(x)
$$

---

The turning point is $(x,y).$ find $x + y$.

If the turning point is a local minimum, subtract $1$ from your answer; if it is a local maximum, add $1$ to your answer.
