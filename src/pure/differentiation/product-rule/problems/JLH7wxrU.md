The temperature $\theta ^{\circ} \text{C}$ inside a refrigerator at time $t \text{hours}$ is modeled by the function
$$
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \cos t \left( \cos t - \sin t \right) + \frac{t}{2}, \quad 0 < t < 3.5
$$

Find the maximum and minimum temperature in the refrigerator as $t$ varies.

Don't expand the bracket - treat $\cos t - \sin t$ as a function, and $\frac{1}{2}\cos t$ as a function, and apply the product rule.

Differentiate the $\frac{t}{2}$ separately.

The maximum temperature is $T$, the minimum temperature is $\tau$.

The value of $T + \tau$ can be written in simplest form as
$$
\frac{a\pi + b}{c}, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Find $a + b + c$.
