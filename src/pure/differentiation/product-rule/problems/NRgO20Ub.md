A function is defined by
$$
f(x) = \sqrt{x}e^{-x}, x \geq 0
$$

The curve $y = f(x)$ is sketched below:

 1. Find, in exact form, the coordinates of the turning point of the curve.

 1. Find the range of the function
    $$
    g(x) = 2 - 2f(x)
    $$

---

For part (a), solve $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$

---

For part (b), consider the transformations
$$
f(x) \rightarrow 2f(x) \rightarrow -2f(x) \rightarrow -2f(x) + 2
$$
and how they would affect the graph of the curve.

---

The range in part (b) is of the form
$$
\left\{ y \in \mathbb{R} : p \leq y \leq q \right\}
$$
The value of $pq$ can be given in simplest form as
$$
a - b \sqrt{\frac{c}{e}}
$$
Give the value of $abc$.
