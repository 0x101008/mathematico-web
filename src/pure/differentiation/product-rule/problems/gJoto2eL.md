A curve is defined by
$$
y = \frac{e^x}{2x}, \quad x \neq 0
$$

 1. Find the equation of the normal to the curve at the point where $x = 2.$

 1. Prove that the curve has a minimum point when $x = 1.$

---

$$
y = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1} e^{x}
$$

For (b), it is not enough to demonstrate that $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ when $x = 0.$ You must use the second derivative test.

The point $(1,\gamma)$ lies on the normal from (a). Given that
$$
\gamma = pe^2 + qe^{-2}, \quad p,q \in \mathbb{Q}
$$
find the vale of
$$
\frac{q}{p}
$$
