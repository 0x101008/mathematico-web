Find the equation of the tangent to the curve
$$
y = x\cos(x)
$$
at the point where
$$
x = \frac{\pi}{3}
$$

---

Use the product rule to find $\frac{dy}{dx}$, and then substitute $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$ into $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the gradient of the tangent.

---

In fully simplified surd form, the $y$ intercept of the tangent is
$$
\frac{\sqrt{m}}{n} \pi^2
$$
Give the value of $mn$.
