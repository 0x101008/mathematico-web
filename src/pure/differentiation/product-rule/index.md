When two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are multiplied together, we get a new function, which we may call $h(x)$:
$$
h(x) = f(x)g(x)
$$
If we can find the gradient of $f$ and $g$, we would like to be able to find the gradient of $h$. Fortunately, the **product rule** can help:
$$
h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$
We will get used to using this rule, and in a later problem we will prove that it works.
