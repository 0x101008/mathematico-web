Let
$$
y = x^{\frac{1}{x}}, \quad x > 0
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = y \frac{\left( 1 - \ln x \right)}{x^2}
    $$

 1. Find the exact value of
    $$
    \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
    $$
    at the maximum point of the curve.

Start by taking $\ln$ of both sides of the equation. After simplifying the right-hand side, you can now use implicit differentiation.

The answer can be given in the form
$$
\kappa e^{\lambda + e^{\mu}}, \quad \kappa, \lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{Z}
$$
Give the value of
$$
\kappa + \lambda + \mu
$$
