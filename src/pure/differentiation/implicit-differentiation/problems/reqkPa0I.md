Let
$$
y = \arcsin(x), \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1
$$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \cos(y) = \sqrt{1-x^2}
    $$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} \arcsin(2x - 1) = \frac{5}{2}
    $$

If the solutions to the equation are $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Q}$, then give the sum of the numerator and denominator of
$$
(\beta - \alpha)^2
$$
