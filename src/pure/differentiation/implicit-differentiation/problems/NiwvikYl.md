The curve $C$ is given by the equation
$$
x - y = 2\ln(xy)
$$

The line $y = x$ intersects with $C$ at the point $A$.

Find the equation of the normal to $C$ at $A$, giving your answer in the form
$$
ax + by + c = 0, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}
$$
where $a>0$ and $a,b,c$ are coprime.

To find $A$, substitute $y = x$ into the equation of $C$ and solve.

---

When differentiating the right hand side, you need to use the chain rule followed by the product rule when differentiating $xy$.
