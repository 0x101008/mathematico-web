Let
$$
y = \arctan(x)
$$

Solve the equation
$$
4 \frac{dy}{dx} = 5 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$

---

If you take $\tan$ of both sides first, you have
$$
\tan(y) = x
$$
and you can use implicit differentiation to find
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

---

If your expression for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ contains a $\sec^2(y)$, remember that
$$
1 + \tan^2(y) = \sec^2(y)
$$
and notice that
$$
\tan(y) = x
$$
so you can give $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $x$ only!

---

Once you have an expression for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $x$ only, you can find $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ without using implicit differentiation - you just need the chain (or quotient) rule.

---

Let the roots be $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Q}$.

give the value of
$$
104(p^3 + q^3)
$$
