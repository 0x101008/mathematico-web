The _Lemniscate of Bernoulli_ is drawn below:

![](/img/learn/implicit-03.svg)

The equation of the curve is
$$
(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^2 - y^2
$$

The lemniscate is contained within a rectangle whose sides lie tangent to the curve. (You are given that the longest sides of the rectangle are horizontal.)

Show that the area of the rectangle is of the form
$$
\sqrt{k}, \quad k \in \mathbb{N}
$$

Give the value of $k$.
