A cone of height $10\text{cm}$ and radius $4\text{cm}$ is being filled with water at a rate of $2\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}.$

Initially, the cone was empty.

 1. Show that the radius of the surface of the water after $5$ seconds is equal to
    $$
    \left( \frac{12}{\pi} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
    $$

 1. Find the rate of change of the radius of the surface of the water after $5$ seconds.

 1. Find the rate of change of the height of the water after $5$ seconds.

Use similar triangles to show that
$$
5r = 2h
$$

---

Use the first hint to show that
$$
V = \frac{5 \pi r^3}{6}
$$
After $5$ seconds, you know that $10\text{cm}^3$ of water has been added, so you can find $r.$

Find $\frac{dV}{dr}$ from
$$
V = \frac{5 \pi r^3}{6}
$$

You know that $\frac{dV}{dt}$ is $2\text{cm}^3{\text{s}^{-1}}$ so you can use
$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dr} \frac{dr}{dt}
$$

---

To find $\frac{dh}{dt},$ remember the first hint!

---

Give
$$
\frac{dh}{dt}
$$
to two decimal places.
