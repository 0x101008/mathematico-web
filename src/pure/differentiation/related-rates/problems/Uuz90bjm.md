A car is driving past a camera. The camera rotates to keep the car in the shot.

When the car is directly in front of the camera, the camera is $15\text{m}$ from the car.

Given that the car is traveling at a constant speed of $30 \text{ms}^{-1},$ how quickly is the camera rotating $2{\text{s}}$ after the car passes level with the camera?

Find the relationship between $\theta$ and $x.$

---

You know that $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is $30.$ You also know that the car must have traveled $60\text{m}$ in $2$ seconds.

What you're trying to find is $\frac{d\theta}{dt}.$
