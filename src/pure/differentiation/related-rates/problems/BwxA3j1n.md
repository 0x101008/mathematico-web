The volume of a sphere is increasing at a rate of $10\text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-1}.$

Find a formula for the rate of increase of the surface area of the sphere, in terms of $r.$

---

We know that $\frac{dV}{dt} = 10.$

If you can find $\frac{dV}{dr}$ and $\frac{dA}{dr}$ then you can use
$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{dA}{dr} \times \frac{dr}{dV} \times \frac{dV}{dt}
$$

Recall that, for a sphere,
$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$
and
$$
A = 4\pi r^2
$$

---

The answer is
$$
\frac{k}{r}
$$
Give the value of $k$
