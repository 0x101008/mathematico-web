A clinometer is measuring the height of an elevator as it ascends. The clinometer is positioned $10 \text{m}$ away from the elevator.

The elevator ascends at a constant speed of $2 \text{ms}^{-1}.$ The angle of the clinometer is $\theta.$

 1. Find an expression for the rate of change of the angle of the clinometer in terms of $\theta.$

 1. How quickly is the angle changing when the elevator is $5\text{m}$ off the ground?

In order to get the exact form, don't use $\arctan$ - rather, recall that
$$
1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta
$$

In simplest terms, the solution is
$$
\frac{p}{q}, \quad p,q \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Give $p+q$
