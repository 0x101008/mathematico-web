The kinetic energy, $E,$ of a mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ is
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
Find the rate of change of the kinetic energy of a car of mass $800\text{kg}$ when it is accelerating at $5\text{m s}^{-2}.$

---

Acceleration means $\frac{dv}{dt}.$

---

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dE}{dv}\frac{dv}{dt}
$$

---

The answer is $\lambda v$.

Give the value of $\lambda$.
