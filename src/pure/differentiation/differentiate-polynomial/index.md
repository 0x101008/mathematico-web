When you are given a function
$$
y = f(x)
$$
and you find
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
$$
this process is called *differentiation.*

We have, until now, used the definition
$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
to calculate $f'(x)$ and, whilst this is completely correct and rigorous, it is slow and difficult.

In this chapter, we are going to differentiate polynomials (and beyond) using the formula
$$
f(x) = x^n \, \Rightarrow \, f'(x) = nx^{n-1}
$$
This formula is proved by the first principles definition - and now we have the formula we never have to use first principles again! (Except in examinations.)

Let's see an example of the formula at work.

 1. Given that
    $$
    y = x^2\left( \sqrt{x} + x^3 \right)
    $$
    find
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx}
    $$

 1. Given that
    $$
    v = \frac{\sqrt[3]{u} + u^{\frac{5}{2}}}{u^{9}}
    $$
    find
    $$
    \frac{dv}{du}
    $$
