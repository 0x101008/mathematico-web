The tangent to the curve
$$
y = (x-2)x(x+3)
$$
at the point $P$ intersects the curve again at the point $Q.$

 1. Given that $P$ has $x$-coordinate $-1,$ show that $Q$ has $x$-coordinate $1$ and find the $y$ coordinate of $Q.$

 1. Prove that the tangent does not intersect the curve for a third time.

Find the equation of the tangent at the point $P.$

You will need to expand the cubic in order to differentiate it.

---

In the end, you should find yourself solving the equation
$$
x^3 + x^2 - x - 1 = 0
$$
It is possible to guess the solutions to this equation.

---

For part (b), you know that $(x-1)$ and $(x+1)$ are both roots of
$$
x^3 + x^2 - x - 1 = 0
$$
Use long division to factorise this cubic and hence prove that the only two solutions represent the $x$-coordinates of $P$ and $Q.$
