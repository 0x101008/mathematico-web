The tangent, $\ell,$ to the curve
$$
y = \sqrt{x}
$$
at the point $P$ has a $y$-intercept of $1.$

 1. Find the coordinates of $P.$

 1. Find the area of the triangle formed by $\ell$ and the coordinate axes.

For (a), let
$$
P = \left( a, \sqrt{a} \right)
$$
Just pretend you know what $a$ is and find the equation of the tangent at $P$ as usual.

---

You have
$$
P = (a, \sqrt{a})
$$
Now,
$$
y = \sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
so
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}x^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}
$$

---

That means the tangent at $P$ (i.e. where $x = a$) has a gradient of
$$
m = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}}
$$
Now use
$$
y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)
$$
You know that $(0,1)$ lies on this line so you can find $a.$

For (b), draw a picture!

You will need to calculate the equation of the tangent line, $\ell.$
