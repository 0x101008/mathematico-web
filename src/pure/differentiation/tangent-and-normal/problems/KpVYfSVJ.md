The equation of the tangent to
$$
y = x^2 + 8x + c
$$
at the point $P$ is
$$
y = 6x + 3
$$
Find the coordinates of $P$ and the value of $c.$

Whilst you can do this with the discriminant, differentiation is probably easier.

Notice that the gradient of the tangent is $6,$ and so, at $P,$
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 6
$$

You also know that $P$ lies on both the line and the parabola, so the coordinates of $P$ satisfy both of their equations.
