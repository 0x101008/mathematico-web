The points $A$ and $B,$ whose $x$ coordinates are $a$ and $b$ respectively, lie on the curve
$$
y = \frac{1}{x}
$$
The point $C$ is the point of intersection of the tangents to the curve at $A$ and $B$.

Given that $ab= - 1,$ prove that $C$ lies on the line $y = -x$

First of all, because $ab = -1$ we have $b = -\frac{1}{a}$

Because $y = \frac{1}{x},$ you can now find the coordinates of both $A$ and $B$ in terms of $a$ only.

You should get
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & = \left(a, \frac{1}{a} \right) \\
B & = \left( -\frac{1}{a}, -a \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
