The function $f$ is defined by
$$
\frac{x}{2} + \sin(x), \quad 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi
$$
Find, and determine the nature of, the turning points of the curve
$$
y = f(x)
$$

---

To locate the turning points, solve $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$

---

Make sure to use the second derivative test when determining the nature of the turning points.

As a fully simplified surd, the $y$ coordinate of the minimum point is
$$
\frac{a\pi - b\sqrt{b}}{c}, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Give the value of $abc$
