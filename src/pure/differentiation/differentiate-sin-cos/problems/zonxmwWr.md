Let
$$
f(x) = \cos(x) - 3 \sin(x)
$$
Find values of $R>0$ and $0 < \alpha < \pi$ such that
$$
f''(x) = R \sin(x-\alpha)
$$
giving the value of $\alpha$ to $3$ significant figures.

Differentiate twice to get $f''(x),$ then put $f''(x)$ into <nuxt-link to="/skills/trigonometry/harmonic-form">harmonic form</nuxt-link>

Give the value of $R\alpha$ to three significant figures.
