Use first principles and small angle approximations to prove that
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = \sin(x) \\[1em]
\Rightarrow \,\frac{dy}{dx} & = \cos(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

By first principles,
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}
$$

---

Use the addition formula for $\sin$:
$$
\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
$$

---

Because $h \rightarrow 0,$ we know that $h$ is small, so $\sin(h)$ and $\cos(h)$ can be replaced by their small angle approximations.
