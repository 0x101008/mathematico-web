## Differentiating $y = \sin(x)$

In the diagram below, the curve
$$
y = \sin(x)
$$
is sketched. At the same time, the traced point represents the value of the gradient of $\sin(x).$

Do you recognise the curve formed by the value of the gradient? It is $\cos(x).$ Interesting!

This suggests that
$$
y = \sin(x) \, \Rightarrow \, \frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x)
$$

## Differentiating $y = \cos(x)$

If we do similar for $y = \cos(x),$ we find the following:

<geogebra id="ytq8ceqy"></geogebra>

The gradient of the curve appears to give $-\sin(x),$ which suggests
$$
y = \cos(x) \, \Rightarrow \, \frac{dy}{dx} = -\sin(x)
$$

Find the gradient of the curve
$$
y = 2\sin(x) - 3\cos(x)
$$
at the point where
$$
x = \frac{\pi}{6}
$$
