An alternative notation for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is $f'(x).$ So
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = f(x) \\
\Rightarrow \, \frac{dy}{dx} & = f'(x)
\end{aligned}
$$
($f'(x)$ is pronounced "$f$ prime of $x$")

 1. A function $f$ is defined by
    $$
    f(x) = \sqrt{x}, \quad x > 0
    $$
    Use first principles to find the gradient function $f'(x).$

 1. Hence, find the value of $f'(1)$ and explain the meaning of this value.

For (a), you should start with the definition
$$
\begin{aligned}
f'(x)
& = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\
& = \frac{\sqrt{x+h} - \sqrt{x}}{h}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

In order to proceed, trying multiplying the top and bottom of this fraction by
$$
(\sqrt{x+h} + \sqrt{x})
$$

The gradient of the curve at the point where $x = a$ is $\frac{1}{4}$. Give the value of $a$.
