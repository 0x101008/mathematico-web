When we studied the number $e,$ we found that the function
$$
f(x) = e^x
$$
satisfies
$$
f'(x) = e^x
$$
as is suggested by the graph below:

You are given that
$$
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \, \frac{e^h - 1}{h} = 1
$$
(This is hard to prove - you may use it without proof.)

Prove, from first principles, that
$$
f(x) = e^x \Rightarrow f'(x) = e^x
$$

$$
e^{x+h} = e^{x}e^{h}
$$
