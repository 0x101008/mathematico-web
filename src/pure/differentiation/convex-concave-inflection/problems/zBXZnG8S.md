A student claims that

 > If a curve $y = f(x)$ satisfies $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ at some point, then it has a point of inflection at that point.

Explain, with the aid of a diagram, why
$$
y = x^4
$$
is a counterexample to this claim.

You can show that the curve has a local minimum point at $x = 0$ by considering the fact that the curve is symmetrical about the $y$ axis (because $f(x) = f(-x)$, i.e. the function $x^4$ is _even_).
