A curve is given by
$$
y = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 6
$$

 1. Find the coordinates of the stationary point of the curve.

 1. Find the coordinates of the point of inflection of the curve.

 1. A student believes that
 
    > For any curve, if $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ at some point, then the curve has a turning point at that point.

    Explain, by drawing an appropriate diagram, why
    $$
    y = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 6
    $$
    is a counterexample to this claim.
