Let
$$
f(x) = \frac{4e^{2x} + 1}{e^x}
$$

 1. Find $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$

 1. Hence, find the minimum value of $f,$ justifying that this is a minimum point.

---

Express $f$ in the form
$$
f(x) = 4e^x + e^{-x}
$$
in order to differentiate it

---

Remember that $\ln(x)$ and $e^x$ are **inverse** to each other, which means
$$
\ln(e^x) = x
$$
and
$$
e^{\ln(x)} = x
$$

---

You must use the second derivative test to determine the nature of the turning point.
