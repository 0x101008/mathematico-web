The half-life of Uranium-235 is approximately $704$ million years, meaning this is the time taken for the mass of a sample to reduce by one half.

The mass $M$ grams of Uranium in a sample with initial size $M_0$ may be modeled by
$$
M(t) = M_0 e^{\lambda t}
$$
where $t$ is measured in millions of years.

A $10\text{g}$ sample of Uranium-235 is obtained by a laboratory.

 1. Find the value of $\lambda$

 1. Find the rate at which the mass is initially decaying, giving the correct units for your answer.

 1. How much Uranium-235 will be present in the sample after ten million years?
