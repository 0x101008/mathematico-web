The number of people $P$ infected with a virus after $t$ days is modeled using the exponential function
$$
P = e^{kt}
$$
where $k$ is a constant.

 1. Explain the significance of the number $k.$

 1. It is estimated that the virus first passed to a human on $1^{\text{st}}$ December, and that on $20^{\text{th}}$ December there were $50$ people infected. According to the model, how many people will be infected on $31^{\text{st}}$ January?

 1. On what date does the model predict the number of infected people would exceed one million?

 1. Find the rate at which the virus is spreading after $10$ weeks, giving the correct units for your answer.

 1. Give one criticism of the model.
