The image below depicts the curve given by
$$
y = e^{2x} - 10e^{x} + 8x + 24
$$

Determine, in exact form, the coordinates of $A$ and $B.$

(You do not need to justify the nature of the turning points.)

The sum of all coordinates $x_A + x_B + y_A + y_B$ can be expressed as
$$
\ln(2^k) + n, \quad k,n \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Give the value of $k + n$
