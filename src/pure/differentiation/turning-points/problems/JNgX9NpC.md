The function $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = \frac{1-x}{x^2}, \quad x > 0
$$

 1. Prove that $f$ has a local minimum when $x = 2.$

 1. Hence, explain why $f^{-1}$ does not exist.

For (a), you must prove that $x = 2$ gives a turning point using $f'$, **and** prove that this is a minimum point using $f''$.

---

For (b), what does the curve look like near the local minimum? Can you explain why it must be many-to-one? It would be helpful if your explanation included a sketch.
