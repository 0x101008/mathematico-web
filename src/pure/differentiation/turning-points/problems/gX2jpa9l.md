Find the range of values of $k$ such that
$$
f(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^3 + kx^2 + 2kx + k
$$
is invertible.

---

First, prove that if $f'(x)$ has exactly two roots, then one must be a maximum point and the other must be a minimum point. (You will need to use $f$ and $f'$ for this.)

---

And if it has a local maximum or a local minimum point, it can't be invertible (why?)
