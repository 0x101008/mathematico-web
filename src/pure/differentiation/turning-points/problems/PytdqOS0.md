Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and consider the curve
$$
y = f(x)
$$

 1. By completing the square on $f(x),$ find the coordinates of the vertex.

 1. Find the coordinates of the vertex using differentiation (isn't that easier!)

 1. Use the second derivative test to prove that the parabola is $\cup$ shaped when $a>0$ and $\cap$ shaped when $a<0.$

For (a), you need to remove the $a$ from the first two terms:
$$
a \left[ x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x \right] + c
$$
Now you're ready to complete the square.

For (b), note that $c$ is a constant so differentiates to $0.$
