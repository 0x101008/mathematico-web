Let
$$
f(x) = (x-a)^2(x-b), \quad a \neq b
$$

 1. Prove that $x = a$ is both a root and a stationary point of the cubic curve $y = f(x).$

 1. Prove that $x = a$ gives a minimum of $f(x)$ if $a > b,$ and a maximum point if $a < b.$ Sketch the curve in both cases.

(This finally explains why a repeated root of a cubic *just touches* the $x$ axis, something that we had only assumed until now.)

---

Expand and differentiate. Demonstrate that $x = a$ is a root of both $f(x)$ and $f'(x).$

---

For (b), you should find that
$$
f''(a) = 2(a-b)
$$

---

In order to sketch the cubics, notice that the coefficient of $x^3$ in $f(x)$ is $1,$ which is positive, so this is an *up-down-up* cubic.

You can slide $a$ and $b$ around in this picture to help:
