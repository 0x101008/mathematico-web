The rectangle $PQRS$ is formed under the curve
$$
y = \sqrt{x}, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 4
$$

The point $P$ lies on the curve.

The point $Q$ has $x$ coordinate $4$ and lies on the same horizontal line as $P.$

The points $S$ and $R$ lie on the $x$ axis directly beneath $P$ and $Q$ respectively.

Find the largest possible area for the rectangle.

Here is a diagram:

Try moving $P$ to get a sense for the problem.

If you let $P = \left(p, \sqrt{p} \right)$ then you can find the area $A$ of the triangle in terms of $p.$

The solution is of the form
$$
\frac{m^2 \sqrt{n}}{n^2}
$$
for some $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Find $m^2 + n^2$.
