An isosceles triangle with perimeter $12$ is constructed.

 1. Find the largest possible area of the triangle.

 1. Explain the significance of your solution.

It would be convenient to let the two equal sides have length $a$, and then the base of the triangle have length $2b$ for some $b$, as below:

Because the perimeter is $12$, we have
$$
2a + 2b = 12
$$
Also, by Pythagoras, we have
$$
a^2 = b^2 + h^2
$$

---

If you want to maximise
$$
A = \frac{1}{2} bh
$$
it would be sufficient to maximise $A^2$. This makes the problem much easier.

---

Get $A^2$ in terms of $b$ only, and solve
$$
\frac{d(A^2)}{db} = 0
$$
to find the turning point.

---

As a fully simplified surd, the area is
$$
p\sqrt{q}
$$
Give the value of $q^p$.
