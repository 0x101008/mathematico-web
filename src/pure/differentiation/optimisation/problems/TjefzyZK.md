An open, right-circular cone of radius $r$ and height $h$ has a volume of $36\pi \, \text{m}^3.$

 1. Show that the surface area, $A,$ satisfies
    $$
    A^2 = k \pi^2 \left( kh^{-2} + h \right)
    $$
    where $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is a number to be determined.

 1. Hence, find the smallest possible value for the surface area of the exterior of the cone, giving your answer in the form
    $$
    k \pi \sqrt{3}, \quad k \in \mathbb{N}
    $$

The volume of a cone is
$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
$$
The surface area of the curved part of the cone is
$$
\pi r s
$$
where $s$ is the *slant height*:

Since the cone is open, there is no circular base.

The slant height is the hypotenuse of this right-angled triangle:

As $A$ increases, $A^2$ increases, so to find the $h$ which minimises $A$ you can find the $h$ which minimises $A^2.$ In other words, solve
$$
\frac{d\left(A^2\right)}{dh} = 0
$$

---

Give the value of $k$.
