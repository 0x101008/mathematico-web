Given that the surface area of the cylinder is $60 \text{cm}^2,$ find the maximum volume of the cylinder.

If you open out the cylinder, you see it is made from two circles and a rectangle, whose width is the circumference of the circular top.

The solution can be given as
$$
\frac{2a\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{\pi}}
$$
for square-free $a \in \mathbb{N}$. Find the value of $a$.
