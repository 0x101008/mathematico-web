The four shaded squares of side length $x \text{cm}$ are to be cut away, and the card will be folded along the dashed lines to form a cuboid-shaped tray.

Find the largest possible volume of the tray, and the value of $x$ for which this occurs.

Justify, using the second derivative test, that the volume you have found is a maximum.
