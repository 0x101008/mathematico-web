## Notes

Suppose we want to find the values of $x$ which satisfy the quadratic equation

$$
x^2 + 12x + 35 = 0
$$

These values of $x$ are called the **roots** of the quadratic, and one way to
find them is by **factorising** into brackets:

$$
(x+5)(x+7) = 0
$$

In the examples, we'll learn how and why this works - once you've watched the
example, test your understanding by having a go at the exercise below.

## Example

<Example :id="$frontmatter.vimeo">

By first factorising, solve the following equations:

1.  $x^2 + 12x + 35 = 0$

1.  $3x^2 - 3x - 18 = 0$

1.  $10 - t^2 = 50 - 14t$

</Example>
