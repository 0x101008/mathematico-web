Sometimes, an equation can have a quadratic structure even if it is not a quadratic. For example,
$$
x^6 + 2x^3 - 8 = 0
$$
can be written as
$$
\left(x^3\right)^2 + 2x^3 - 8 = 0
$$
If we let $u = x^3$ this becomes even clearer:
$$
u^2 + 2u - 8 = 0
$$
If we can find $u$, then we can find $x^3$ and hence $x$.

Let's see some examples.

Solve the equations

 1. $x^6 - 6x^3 + 8 = 0$

 1. $72 - 18\sqrt{x} + x = 0$
