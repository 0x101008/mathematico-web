Solve the equation
$$
\left( x^2 + 3x + 2 \right)^2 - 8\left( x^2 + 3x + 1 \right) + 4 = 0
$$

---

This is *almost* a quadratic in disguise... we just need to make a minor adjustment

---

Try this:
$$
\left( x^2 + 3x + 2 \right)^2 - 8\left( [x^2 + 3x + 2] - 1 \right) + 4 = 0
$$

---

So the equation becomes:
$$
\left( x^2 + 3x + 2 \right)^2 - 8\left( x^2 + 3x + 2 \right) + 12 = 0
$$
Now let
$$
u = x^2 + 3x + 2
$$
and keep solving!

There are $n$ solutions, and the sum of these solutions is $S$.

Give
$$
S^n
$$
