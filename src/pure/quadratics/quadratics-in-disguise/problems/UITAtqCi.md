A student writes the below argument:

 > Consider
 > $$
 > ax^4 + bx^2 + c = 0
 > $$
 > If
 > $$
 > b^2 - 4ac > 0
 > $$
 > then the equation has four, distinct, real solutions.

Find a counterexample to the student's claim.

Whilst it is true that
$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 = \alpha \quad & \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{\alpha} \\
x^2 = \beta \quad & \Rightarrow \quad  x = \pm \sqrt{\beta}
\end{aligned}
$$
might provide four solutions, what if $\alpha < 0$?
