Prove that
$$
3^8 - 2^8
$$
is divisible by $5$.

---

Note that we have
$$
3^8 - 2^8 = \left( 3^4 \right)^2 - \left( 2^4 \right)^2
$$
which is a difference of two squares.

---

So
$$
\begin{aligned}
3^8 - 2^8 & = \left( 3^4 \right)^2 - \left( 2^4 \right)^2 \\
& = \left( 3^4 - 2^4 \right)\left( 3^4 + 2^4 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
That $3^4 - 2^4$ looks interesting...
