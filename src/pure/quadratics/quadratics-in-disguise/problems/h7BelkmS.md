Solve the inequality
$$
x + 8 < 6\sqrt{x}
$$

---

Rearrange into the form
$$
x - 6\sqrt{x} + 8 < 0
$$

---

This is
$$
\left(\sqrt{x}\right)^2 - 6\sqrt{x} + 8 < 0
$$
so let $u = \sqrt{x}$

---

Sketch
$$
y = u^2 - 6u + 8
$$
and look for parts of the parabola below the $x$ axis

---

The answer is of the form
$$
\alpha < x < \beta
$$
Give the value of
$$
\alpha \beta
$$
