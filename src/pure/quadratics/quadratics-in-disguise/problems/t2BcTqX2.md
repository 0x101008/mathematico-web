Let
$$
y = \frac{1-6x+3x^2}{x^2}, \quad x \neq 0
$$
Find the smallest possible value of $y$.

---

Split this into $3$ fractions:
$$
y = \frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{6x}{x^2} + \frac{3x^2}{x^2}
$$

---

After simplifying you get
$$
y = \frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{6}{x} + 3
$$
This is a quadratic in disguise!

---

We have
$$
y = \left( \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 - 6 \left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + 3
$$
Let $u = \frac{1}{x}$ and complete the square to find the minimum value.

Give the minimum value below.
