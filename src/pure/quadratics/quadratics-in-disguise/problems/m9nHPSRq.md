Solve the equation
$$
(x^2 + 2x + 1)^2 - 3(x+1)^2 - 4 = 0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
$$

---

Note that
$$
x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x+1)^2
$$

---

So the equation becomes
$$
\left((x + 1)^2\right)^2 - 3(x+1)^2 - 4 = 0
$$

---

Let
$$
u = (x+1)^2
$$
and solve

---

The roots are $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Give the value of
$$
\alpha^3 + \beta^3
$$
