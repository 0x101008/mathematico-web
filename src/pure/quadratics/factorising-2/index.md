Sometimes, our quadratics can look a little bit trickier. If they are of the form
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
where $a \neq 0$ they are harder to factorise. For these harder quadratics, we're going to learn a method called *splitting the middle*.

As before, it is important to get $0$ on one side of the equation before we begin.

Solve the following equations:

 1. $2 y^{2} - 7 = 5 y$

 1. $- 8 x^{2} - 24 x + 11 = -3$

 1. $2 p^{2} - 12 p + 21 = 3$
