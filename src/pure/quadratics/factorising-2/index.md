## Notes

Sometimes, our quadratics can look a little bit trickier. If they are of the
form

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

where $a \neq 1$ they are harder to factorise. For these harder quadratics,
we're going to learn a method called _splitting the middle_.

As before, it is important to get $0$ on one side of the equation before we
begin.

## Example

<Example :id="$frontmatter.vimeo">

Solve the following equations:

1.  $2 y^{2} - 7 = 5 y$

1.  $- 8 x^{2} - 24 x + 11 = -3$

1.  $2 p^{2} - 12 p + 21 = 3$

</Example>
