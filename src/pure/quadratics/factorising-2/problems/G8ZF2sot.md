Solve the equations

 1. $2^{x^{2}} = 16^{x+3}$

 1. $9^{x^{2}} = 3^{5x-3}$

 1. $8^{x^{2}} = \frac{4^{4x}}{16}$

 1. $\left( 2^x \right)^{2} = 2^{x^{2}}$

---

For part (a), we know that $16 = 2^4$, so we can write
$$
\begin{aligned}
2^{x^2} & = \left( 2^4 \right)^{(x+3)} \\
2^{x^2} & = 2^{4(x+3)}
\end{aligned}
$$
which is true if (and only if)
$$
x^2 = 4(x+3)
$$
This is a quadratic! Rearrange and solve.

Parts (b), (c), (d) can be approached in a similar way.

---

Let $P$ be the product of all non-zero solutions to (a), (b) and (c).
