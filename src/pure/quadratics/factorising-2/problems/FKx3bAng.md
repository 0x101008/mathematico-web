Solve the equations

 1. $2x^3 - 2x^2 - 12x = 0$

 1. $6x^3 - 3x^2 - 45x = 0$

---

For each equation, it is possible to factorise out an $x$ (and maybe also a common factor out of the coefficients).

---

For example, the first equation can be written as
$$
2x(x^2 - x - 6) = 0
$$

---

Each equation has exactly three solutions (you can't divide by $x$)

---

The sum of the squares of the solutions to (a) and (b) is equal so $S$.

Give the value of
$$
16S
$$
