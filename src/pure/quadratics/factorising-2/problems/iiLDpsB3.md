There are $16$ doughnuts on a table. Some of them have a chocolate filling, and some of them have a raspberry filling, and it is impossible to tell which one is which without eating them!

We do know, however, that there are more raspberry doughnuts than chocolate doughnuts.

We also know that if two doughnuts are eaten at random, the probability they have the same filling is $$\frac{19}{40}.$$

How many chocolate doughnuts are there?

You can use a tree diagram.

---

Let the number of chocolate doughnuts be $x$, then the number of raspberry doughnuts must be $16-x.$

---

If the number of chocolate doughnuts is $x$, and the number of raspberry doughnuts is $y$, give the value of
$$
x^3 + y^2
$$
