Factorise the following quadratic expressions:

 1. $x^2 - 2kx + k^2$

 1. $x^2 - kx - 2k^2$

 1. $3p^2 - 5pq - 2q^2$

---

For the first problem, imagine it in this way
$$
x^2 + \underbrace{(-2k)}_{b} x + \underbrace{k^2}_{c}
$$
So you can begin by writing
$$
(x \qquad )(x \qquad )
$$
and your table should look like
$$
\begin{array}{c}
k^2 \\
\hline \begin{array}{c|c} \pm 1 & \pm k^2 \\
\pm k & \pm k \end{array}
\end{array}
$$
You are searching for the pair from the table which adds together to make $-2k.$

The other two can be treated similarly.

---

Part (c) can be given in the form
$$
(p - aq)(bp + q), \quad a,b \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Give the value of
$$
a^4 + b^4
$$
