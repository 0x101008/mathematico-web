A cylinder has a radius $r$ and a height given by
$$
h = r + 2 + \frac{1}{r}
$$

![Cylinder of radius r and height r + 2 + 1/r](/img/learn/quad-12.svg)

Find a fully factorised expression for the volume of the cylinder, in terms of $r.$

---

The volume, $V,$ of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h.$

---

The answer can be given in the form
$$
k (r+a)(r+b)^c
$$
where $k \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Give
$$
k(a+b+c)
$$
to three significant figures.
