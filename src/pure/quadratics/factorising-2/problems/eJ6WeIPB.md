### Problem 5 <Badge text="modelling" />

A cylinder has a radius $r$ and a height given by

$$
h = r + 2 + \frac{1}{r}
$$

![Cylinder of radius r and height r + 2 + 1/r](/img/learn/quad-12.svg)

A fully factorised expression for the **volume** of the cylinder, in terms of
$r$, can be given in the form

$$
\pi r (r+a)^b
$$

where $k \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Give

$$
\pi (a + b)
$$

to three significant figures

::: details Hint

The volume, $V,$ of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h.$

::: details Solution

The volume, $V,$ of a cylinder is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
V
& = \pi r^2 h \\
& = \pi r^2 \left( r + 2 + \frac{1}{r} \right) \\
& = \pi r (r^2 + 2r + 1) \\
& = \pi r (r + 1)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
