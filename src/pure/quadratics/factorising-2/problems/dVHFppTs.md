The image below shows a circular piece of grass surrounded by a concrete path. The width of the path is equal to $2\text{m}$ 

![Path diagram](/img/learn/quad-13.svg)

Given that the area of the path is three times larger than the area of the grass, find the radius of the grass circle.

---

Let the radius of the grass part be $r$. Then the radius of the outer circle is $r+2$. Recall the area of a circle is $\pi r^{2}.$

---

The area of the concrete is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the grass part.

---

"$A$ is three times bigger than $B$" means $A = 3B$, not the other way round!
