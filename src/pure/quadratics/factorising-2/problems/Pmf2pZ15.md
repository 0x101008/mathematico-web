Let $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ be distinct prime numbers.

 1. Factorise
    $$
    x^2 + px + qx + pq
    $$

 1. Factorise
    $$
    x^2 + pqx + x + pq
    $$

 1. Prove that
    $$
    x^2 + px + qx + x + pq
    $$
    cannot be factorised in the form
    $$
    (x + \alpha)(x + \beta)
    $$
    where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N}$

For the first two expressions, factor out the $x$ from the middle terms and use the familiar pattern of searching for numbers that multiply to $c$ and sum to $b.$

For the proof, you should explain why both $pq, 1$ and $p, q$ are impossible choices. It is important that $p$ and $q$ are distinct and prime!
