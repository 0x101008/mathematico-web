A cuboid has a square base of side-length $x+1$ and a height of
$$
h = 2x + \frac{2}{x+1} + 7
$$

![Cuboid of height 2x + 2/(x+1) + 7](/img/learn/quad-11.svg)

Find a fully factorised expression for the volume of the cuboid.

Don't expand the $(x+1)^2$ you get for the area of the base. Rather, write it as
$$
(x+1)(x+1)
$$
and multiply one of the $(x+1)$ into the expression for the height. The fraction should cancel leaving you with something manageable.

---

The solution can be given in the form
$$
(ax+b)(x+c)(x+d), \quad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Find
$$
(a+b)(c+d)
$$
