### Problem 6 <Badge text="modelling" />

A cuboid has a square base of side-length $x+1$ and a height of

$$
h = 2x + \frac{2}{x+1} + 7
$$

![Cuboid of height 2x + 2/(x+1) + 7](/img/learn/quad-11.svg)

A fully factorised expression for the volume of the cuboid can be given in the
form

$$
(ax+b)(x+c)(x+d), \quad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}
$$

Find

$$
(a + b)(c + d)
$$

::: details Hint

Don't expand the $(x + 1)^2$ you get for the area of the base. Rather, write it
as

$$
(x + 1)(x + 1)
$$

and multiply one of the $(x+1)$ into the expression for the height. The fraction
should cancel leaving you with something manageable.

::: details Solution

The volume is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x + 1)^2\left( 2x + \frac{2}{x + 1} + 7 \right) \\
= {} & (x + 1)[2x(x + 1) + 2 + 7(x + 1)] \\
= {} & (x + 1)(2x^2 + 9x + 9) \\
= {} & (2x + 3)(x + 1)(x + 3)
\end{aligned}
$$
