The expression

$$
10x^7 - 55x^6 - 105x^5
$$

can be given in the form

$$
ax^b (cx + d)(x + e)
$$

Give the value of

$$
abcde
$$

::: details Hint

You can remove a common factor of $5x^5$ before you start.

:::

::: details Solution

We begin by removing the common factor of $5x^5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
10x^7 - 55x^6 - 105x^5
& = 5x^5(2x^2 - 11x + 21) \\
& = 5x^2(2x + 3)(x - 7)
\end{aligned}
$$
