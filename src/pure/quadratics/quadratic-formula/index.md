By now, we have seen that quadratics can be solved by factorising or completing the square. There is a third way, and that is called the *quadratic formula*. Basically, we solve the general equation
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
by completing the square, and we get the formula
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
This is a formula we should memorise as it is very useful for solving hard quadratics quickly.

Solve the following equations using the quadratic formula:

 1. $2x^2 - x - 6 = 0$

 1. $x^2 + 2 - 6x = 0$

 1. $x^2 - 2\sqrt{2}x + 2 = 0$

 1. $x^2 + x = -3$
