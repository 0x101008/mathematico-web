The product of two consecutive even natural numbers is equal to $2024$. What is the sum of these integers?

---

Let the even numbers be
$$
2n \quad \text{and} \quad 2n + 2
$$
You need to solve
$$
2n(2n+2) = 2024
$$

---

You could simplify the equation if you factor out the $2$
$$
4n(n+1) = 2024
$$
and then divide by $4$
$$
n(n+1) = 506
$$
Now expand, collect everything on the left and $0$ on the right.

It is *possible* to factorise this quadratic, but $506$ is a big number so it would be a bit unpleasant - go ahead and use the quadratic formula to solve it!

Recall that _natural numbers_ are positive.
