The circles below have the property that the area of the smaller circle is equal to the circumference of the larger circle.

Find the radius of the smaller circle.

---

Let the smaller circle have radius $r$ and the larger circle have radius $R$.

Then
$$
2R = 2r + 1
$$

---

The relationship between the two circles can be expressed as
$$
\pi r^{2} = 2 \pi R
$$
(It will help to cancel $\pi$ before continuing.)

Give your solution to $3$ significant figures.
