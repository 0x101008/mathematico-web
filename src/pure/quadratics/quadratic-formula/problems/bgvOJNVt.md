One of the solutions in $x$ of the quadratic
$$
x^2 + (k+2)x + k, \quad k < 0
$$
is $3$ larger than the other.

Solve the quadratic equation, giving both possible values of $x$.

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
a & = 1 \\
b & = (k+2) \\
c & = k
\end{aligned}
$$
The quadratic formula tells us the roots are
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_0 & = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
x_1 & = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Since one of the roots is $3$ larger than the other, we have $x_1 = x_0 + 3$ so that $x_1 - x_0 = 3$.

---

You should end up solving
$$
\sqrt{k^2 + 4} = 3
$$
This can be solve by squaring both sides first. (Remember to look at the information in the question: we are told that $k < 0$.)

---

The solutions are $x = \alpha$ and $x = \beta$, where $\alpha < \beta$. Give the value of
$$
5\beta^2 + \alpha^2
$$
