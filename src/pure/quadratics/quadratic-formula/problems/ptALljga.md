At time $t$ hours, where $0 \leq t \leq 3,$ two planes $P$ and $Q$ are cruising at altitudes of
$$
1.1t^2 - 2.3t + 7 \, \text{ miles}
$$
and
$$
6 + 2.4t - 1.2t^2 \, \text{ miles}
$$
respectively.

Find the times at which the vertical distance between the planes is $1$ mile.

To find when $P$ is $1$ mile above $Q$, you need to solve
$$
(1.1t^2 - 2.3t + 7) - (6 + 2.4t - 1.2t^2) = 1
$$
You also need to consider the case when $Q$ is above $P$.

Find the sum of all possible times (in hours), and give your answer to $3$ significant figures.
