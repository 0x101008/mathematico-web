This shape is called a golden rectangle:

![Golden rectangle](/img/learn/quad-20.svg)

It has the property that
$$
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{a+b}{b}
$$

The value of $\frac{b}{a}$ is called $\varphi$ and is known as the golden ratio, a famous number.

Find the value of $\varphi$.

(Don't be shy about using the hint for this one.)

Split the right side into two fractions:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{b}{a} & = \frac{a+b}{b} \\[5pt]
\frac{b}{a} & = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{b}  \\[5pt]
\end{aligned}
$$
Now notice that
$$
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
$$
Replace $\frac{b}{a}$ with $\varphi$ and solve.

---

You should get
$$
\varphi = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}
$$
Multiply both sides by $\varphi$ to get rid of the fraction and then use the quadratic formula.

Given that, in simplest form,
$$
\varphi = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}
$$
give the value of
$$
a + b + c
$$
