When placed $r$ meters apart, the gravitational force, $F,$ between two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by
$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$
where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ is known as the gravitational constant, and $F$ is measured in Newtons.

Two particles are placed $1.75 \, \text{m}$ apart, and the force between them is measured as $1.9 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N}.$ Given that one particle is $18\,\text{kg}$ heavier than the other, find the mass of the lighter particle.

Let the lighter particle have mass $m,$ so the heavier particle has mass $m + 18$. Substitute all of the information into the formula and solve the resulting quadratic.

Give your answer in $\text{kg}$, correct to three significant figures.
