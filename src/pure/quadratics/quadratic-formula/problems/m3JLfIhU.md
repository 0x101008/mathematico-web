One of the solutions of equation
$$
x + 4 = \frac{k}{x}
$$
is $x = \sqrt{5} - 2$.

Find the other value of $x$ which satisfies the equation.

---

It's best to multiply by $x$ to get
$$
x^2 + 4x - k = 0
$$
Now substitute $x = \sqrt{5}-2$ to find the value of $k.$

---

Once you know $k,$ this becomes a quadratic which you can solve using the formula.

---

Let the other value of $x$ which solves this equation be $\beta$. Then
$$
(\beta + k)^2 = a + b\sqrt{c}, \quad a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}
$$
where the right hand side is in simplest form. Give the value of $abc$.
