## Notes

The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

are given by

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

But the $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ can cause problems. Sometimes $b^2 - 4ac < 0$ and so
we can't find the square root (as a real number). Thus, we say that the
quadratic has no real solutions.

The number

$$
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
$$

is called **the discriminant** and it tells us _how many real roots_ a quadratic
has.

::: tip :star: Remember

$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ is called the **discriminant**.

If $\Delta > 0$ then the quadratic has two distinct, real roots.

If $\Delta = 0$ then the quadratic has one real root.

If $\Delta < 0$ then the quadratic has no real roots.

## Example

<Example>

1.  Find the number of real solutions to the equation

    $$
    x^2 + 4x = 21
    $$

1.  Find the number of real roots of the equation

    $$
    4(15x - x^2) = 225
    $$

1.  How many real values of $n$ satisfy

    $$
    - 5 - n - \frac{n^2}{2} = 0
    $$

1.  Given that the equation
    $$
    kx + k - 1 + x^2 = 0
    $$
    has a repeated root, find the value of $k$.
