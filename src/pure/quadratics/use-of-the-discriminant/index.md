The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
are given by
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
But the $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ can cause problems. Sometimes $b^2 - 4ac < 0$ and so we can't find the square root (as a real number). Thus, we say that the quadratic has no real solutions.

The number
$$
b^2 - 4ac
$$
is called **the discriminant** and it tells us *how many real roots* a quadratic has.

    $$

 1. Find the number of real roots of the equation
    $$

 1. How many real values of $n$ satisfy
    $$
    - 5 - n - \frac{n^2}{2} = 0
    $$

 1. Given that the equation
    $$
    kx + k - 1 + x^2 = 0
    $$
    has a repeated root, find the value of $k$.
