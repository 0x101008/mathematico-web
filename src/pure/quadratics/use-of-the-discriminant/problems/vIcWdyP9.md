The quadratic equation
$$
x^2 - 2x - (k + 1) = 0
$$
has exactly two distinct solutions. Find the range of possible values of $k$.

$$
b^2 - 4ac > 0
$$

If your answer is of the form
 - $k > \alpha$, give the value of $\alpha^3$
 - $k \geq \alpha$, give the value of $\alpha^5$
 - $k < \alpha$, give the value of $\alpha^7$
 - $k \leq \alpha$, give the value of $\alpha^9$
