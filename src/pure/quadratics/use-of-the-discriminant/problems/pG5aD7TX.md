Prove that the equation
$$
(x-p)(x-q) = r^2
$$
has at least one real solution in $x$ for any choice of $p,q,r \in \mathbb{R}.$

Expand and collect as so:
$$
x^2 - (p+q)x + pq - r^2 = 0
$$
So you get
$$
\begin{aligned}
a & = 1 \\
b & = -(p+q) \\
c & = pq - r^2
\end{aligned}
$$
Now consider the discriminant.
