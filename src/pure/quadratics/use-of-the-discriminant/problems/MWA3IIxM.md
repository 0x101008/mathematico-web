A car is purchased. Over the next $80$ years, the value of the car is expected to decline, and then increase as it becomes a vintage collector's item.

The value $\text{£}V$ of the car $t$ years after purchase is modeled by the formula
$$
V = 7t^2 - 650t + 20000, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 80
$$

 1. How much did the car cost when it was newly purchased?

 1. Prove that the value of the car never reaches $\text{£}4500$

 1. If the car is bought in the year $2020,$ during which other year will the car attain the same value as it has in the year $2100$?

For (b), consider the discriminant of the equation
$$
V = 4500
$$
(Remember that you need to rearrange to get $0$ on one side before you can use the discriminant.)

---

For (c), the value of the car in the year $2100$ is given when $t = 80$.

Give the answer to part (c)
