Prove that there is no choice of real numbers $p$ and $q$ such that
$$
p^2 = 2(p + q - q^2 - pq - 1)
$$

---

Collect this into a quadratic in terms of $p$. Get the discriminant in terms of $q$.

---

When you have your expression for the discriminant, can you explain why it is negative for all values of $q$?
