A parabola $P$ is drawn in the $xy$ plane.

The vertex of the parabola is $(p,q)$, where $q < 0$.

Given that the parabola is $\cup$ shaped, prove that the parabola intersects the $x$ axis in two distinct points.

(You might think that this is obvious, but there are plenty of seemingly obvious statements in mathematics which turn out to be false on closer inspection - an algebraic proof is needed!)

Because the parabola is $\cup$ shaped, the complete square form of its equation must be
$$
y = a(x-p)^2 + q
$$
where $a > 0$ and $q < 0$.

Expand
$$
y = a(x-p)^2 + q
$$
and calculate the discriminant.
