Given that the quadratic
$$
(r+1)x^2 + 2rx + (r-3) = 0
$$
has no real solutions, find the range of possible values of $r$.

$$
b^2 - 4ac < 0
$$

If your answer is of the form
 - $r > \alpha$, give the value of $(2\alpha)^3$
 - $r \geq \alpha$, give the value of $(2\alpha)^5$
 - $r < \alpha$, give the value of $(2\alpha)^7$
 - $r \leq \alpha$, give the value of $(2\alpha)^9$
