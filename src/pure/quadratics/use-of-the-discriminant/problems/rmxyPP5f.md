By calculating the discriminant, match each parabola to the equation.

 1. $y = 2x^2 - x + 1$

 1. $y = 9x^2 + 12x + 4$

 1. $y = x^2 + x - 2$

Let $a,b,c = 2,3,5$ and $f,g,h = 7,11,13$. Multiply the function's number by the equation you believe it goes with. For example, if you believe (a) goes with function $f$, multiply $2 \times 7$ to get $14$.

Calculate three numbers in this way, and give the sum of your three numbers below.
