By calculating the discriminant, match each parabola to the equation.

1.  $y = 2x^2 - x + 1$

1.  $y = 9x^2 + 12x + 4$

1.  $y = x^2 + x - 2$

Calculate the product of the primes corresponding to your matching and give your
answer below

|     | $f$  | $g$  | $h$  |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| (a) | $2$  | $3$  | $5$  |
| (b) | $7$  | $11$ | $13$ |
| (c) | $17$ | $19$ | $23$ |

::: details Hint

The number of roots is equal to the number of $x$-intercepts.

::: details Solution

1. $b^2 - 4ac = -7 < 0$ so this must be $g$

1. $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ so this must be $f$

1. $b^2 - 4ac = 9 > 0$ so this must be $h$

For our answer, we have $3 \times 7 \times 23 = 483$.
