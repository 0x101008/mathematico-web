The parabola
$$
y = 4x^2 + 4(2k+1)x + 2k^2 + 4k + 9
$$
is sketched below.

Find the value of $k.$

---

There's only one root, so $\Delta = 0$.

Only one of the values of $k$ you get is valid. Can you decide which one?

---

Notice that the root occurs when $x$ is positive - this allows you to eliminate one value of $k$.

---

Give the sum of all possible values of $k$.
