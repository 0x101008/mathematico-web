Prove that the quadratic equation

$$
px^2 + (2p + 1)x + p + 1 = 0
$$

has exactly two solutions for all real values of $p$.

::: details Hint

Express the discriminant in terms of $p$ and use completing the square to find
its minimum value.

::: details Solution

The discriminant of

$$
px^2 + (2p + 1)x + p + 1 = 0
$$

is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta
& = (2p + 1)^2 - 4p(p + 1) \\
& = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 - 4p^2 - 4p \\
& = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

We see that, regardless of the value of $p$, $\Delta = 1 > 0$. Since the
discriminant is therefore positive, the quadratic has two disctinct roots for
all $p \in \mathbb{R}$.
