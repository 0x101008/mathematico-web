## Notes

In the picture below, $A$ and $B$ are _points of intersection_ between

$$
y = x + 2
$$

and

$$
y = x^2 - 2x + 2
$$

Notice that there could be either $2, 1$ or $0$ points of intersection depending
on the position of the line.

When there is only one point of intersection, we say that the line is a
**tangent** to the parabola:

We're going to learn to find points of intersection, and solve problems about
points of intersection.

## Example

<Example>

Find the points of intersection between the line

$$
y = -4x - 1
$$

and the parabola

$$
y = 7 - x^2
$$
