In the picture below, $A$ and $B$ are *points of intersection* between
$$
y = x + k
$$
and
$$
y = x^2 - 2x + 2
$$

<geogebra id="whcd9mbw"></geogebra>

Notice that there can be either $2, 1$ or $0$ points of intersection depending on the position of the line.

Try moving the slider for $k$ so that there is exactly $1$ point of intersection. What value of $k$ does this occur for?

We're going to learn to find points of intersection, and solve problems about points of intersection.

Find the points of intersection between the line
$$
y = -4x - 1
$$
and the parabola
$$
y = 7 - x^2
$$
