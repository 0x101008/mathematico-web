Prove that the parabola

$$
y = x^2 + 10x + 2
$$

lies entirely above the line

$$
y = 4x - 8
$$

::: details Hint

Is the parabola convex or concave?

:::details Hint

Consider the discriminant of

$$
x^2 + 10x + 2 = 4x - 8
$$

::: details Solution

FConsider the discriminant of

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + 10x + 2 & = 4x - 8 \\
x^2 + 6x + 10 & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

which is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta
& = 6^2 - 4(1)(10) \\
& = - 4 \\
& < 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The discriminant is negative, so the parabola and line never intersect.

Now let's let $x = 0$. For the parabola, $y = 2$ and for the line $y = -8$.
Therefore the point on the parabola lies above the point on the line. But since
the parabola and line never intersect, then all points on the parabola must lie
above the line.
