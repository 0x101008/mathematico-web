Prove that the parabola

$$
y = x^2 + 10x + 2
$$

lies entirely above the line

$$
y = 4x - 8
$$

::: details Hint

Is the parabola convex or concave?

:::details Hint

Consider the discriminant of

$$
x^2 + 10x + 2 = 4x - 8
$$

::: details Solution

First, we note that the parabola is convex, so it opens upwards.

Next, consider the discriminant of

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + 10x + 2 & = 4x - 8 \\
x^2 + 6x + 10 & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

which is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta
& = 6^2 - 4(1)(10) \\
& = - 4 \\
& < 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The discriminant is negative, so the parabola and line never intersect. Since
the parabola is convex, this must mean the parabola lies entirely above the
line. (If any point on the parabola were below the line, they would have to
intersect eventually.)
