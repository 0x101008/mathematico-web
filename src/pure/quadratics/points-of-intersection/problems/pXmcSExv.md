The line $y = 2x - 2$ intersects the parabola
$$
y = 2x^2 +11x + c
$$
at two distinct points. One of those points is $(-5,-12).$

Find the coordinates of the other point and the value of $c.$

---

$(-5,-12)$ lies on the parabola, so it satisfies its equation. Substitute the point into the equation to find $c$.

---

The other point of intersection is $(p,q)$. Give the value of
$$
100c(p^3 + q^3)
$$
