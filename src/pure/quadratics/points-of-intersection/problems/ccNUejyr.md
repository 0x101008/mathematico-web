The equation

$$
x^2 + 1 = mx
$$

is required to have only one real solution. Use the discriminant.

::: details Solution

The equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + 1 & = mx \\
x^2 - mx + 1 & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

has only one solution.

Considering the discriminant

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta & = 0 \\
m^2 - 4 & = 0 \\
(m - 2)(m + 2) & = 0 \\
m \in \{-2, 2 \}
\end{aligned}
$$
