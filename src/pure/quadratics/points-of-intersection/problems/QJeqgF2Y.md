The two parabolas shown have equations
$$
y = x^2 + 2ax + p
$$
and
$$
y = -x^2 + 2bx + q
$$
The vertex of each parabola lies upon the other.

Given that the area of the triangle $ABC$ is $1000,$ find the value of $a + b.$

Complete the square to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B.$ You don't actually need the coordinates of $C,$ you can find the base and height of the triangle just by using $A$ and $B$ and symmetry.

---

The vertex of $B$ lies on $y = x^2 + 2ax + p,$ so the coordinates of $B$ must satisfy this equation. This helps you get rid of $p$ and $q$ from the problem.

Don't expand out,
$$
(a+b)(a^2 + b^2 + 2ab)
$$
but notice that
$$
a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2
$$
