The parabola
$$
y = 2 - x^2
$$
and the line
$$
y = 2x + 4
$$
are drawn in the plane.

The points $P$ and $Q$ lie on the parabola and the line respectively, such that $PQ$ is a vertical line.

Then length of $PQ$ is $d$.

 1. Prove that $d > 0$.

 1. Find the smallest possible value of $d$.

For (a), it is enough to show that the parabola and line never intersect (use the discriminant).

Here is a diagram to help (you can move $P$ around):

Since $Q$ lies above $P$, the distance $d$ is given by the $y$ coordinate of $Q$ minus the $y$ coordinate of $P$

---

So
$$
d = (2x + 4) - (2 - x^2)
$$

---

Give the smallest value of $d$.
