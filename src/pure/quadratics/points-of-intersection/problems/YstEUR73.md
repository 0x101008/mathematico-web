If a line and a parabola intersect exactly once, the line is said to be a
**tangent** to the parabola.

Given that the line with equation

$$
y = x + k
$$

is a tangent to the parabola with equation

$$
y = x^2 - 2x + 2
$$

find the value of $504k$

::: details Hint

The equation

$$
x^2 - 2x + 2 = x + k
$$

has exactly one solution.

:::

::: details Hint

So the discriminant of

$$
x^2 - 2x + 2 = x + k
$$

must be $0$.

:::

::: details Solution

The equation

$$
x^2 - 2x + 2 = x + k
$$

has exactly one solution, so the discriminant of

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 - 2x + 2 & = x + k \\
x^2 - 3x + (2 - k) & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

must be $0$. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
9 - 4(2 - k) & = 0 \\
1 + 4k & = 0 \\
k & = -\frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$
