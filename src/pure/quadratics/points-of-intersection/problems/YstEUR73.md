If a line and a parabola intersect exactly once, the line is said to be a **tangent** to the parabola.

Given that the line with equation
$$
y = x + k
$$
is a tangent to the parabola with equation
$$
y = x^2 - 2x + 2
$$
find the value of $k$

---

The equation
$$
x^2 - 2x + 2 = x + k
$$
has exactly one solution.

---

So the discriminant of
$$
x^2 - 2x + 2 = x + k
$$
must be $0$.

Give the value of
$$
504k
$$
