Prove algebraically that, for any $m \in \mathbb{R}$, the straight line

$$
y = mx - m + 2
$$

intersects the parabola

$$
y = 2 - 2x + x^2
$$

in two distinct points.

(Proofs based on graphical methods will gain no credit.)

::: details Hint

Consider the discriminant of

$$
mx - m + 2 = 2 - 2x + x^2
$$

::: details Solution

We consider the discriminant of

$$
\begin{aligned}
mx - m + 2 & = 2 - 2x + x^2 \\
x^2 - (m + 2)x + m & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

which is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta
& = (m + 2)^2 - 4m \\
& = m^2 + 4m + 4 - 4m \\
& = m^2 + 4
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly $m^2 + 4 > 0$ for all choices of $m \in \mathbb{R}$, and so the equation
must have two distinct solutions.
