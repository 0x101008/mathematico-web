We have already seen that the **vertex** of a parabola is the lowest (or highest) point on the parabola. It is sometimes called the **turning point** or the **maximum/minimum point**.

In the picture below

 - move the point $P$ to the minimum point, $(-1,-2)$, of its parabola

 - move the point $Q$ to the maximum point, $(2.5,1)$, of its parabola

We have seen how to find the vertex by looking at the midpoint of the roots, but if there are no roots this cannot work. Fortunately, completing the square can help.

Use completing the square to find the coordinates of the vertex of each parabola.

 1. $y = x^2 - 6x + 4$

 1. $y = -x^2 - 8x - 9$

 1. $y = 3x^2 + 6x - 1$

 1. $y = -2x^2 + 3x + 1$

 1. $y = 1 - x^2$
