## Notes

The points $P$ and $Q$ below are called the **vertex** of their parabolas.

<!-- <geogebra id="wvqaxkpw"></geogebra> -->

![parabolas with vertex](/img/learn/parabolas-04.svg)

If the parabola is concave, the vertex is the maximum point. This is the case
for $P$.

But if the parabola is convex, the vertex is the minimum point. This is the case
for $Q$.

We have seen how to find the vertex by looking at the midpoint of the roots, but
if there are no roots this cannot work. Fortunately, **completing the square**
can help.

## Example

<Example :vimeo="$frontmatter.vimeo">

Use completing the square to find the coordinates of the vertex of each
parabola.

1.  $y = x^2 - 6x + 4$

1.  $y = -x^2 - 8x - 9$

1.  $y = 3x^2 + 6x - 1$

1.  $y = -2x^2 + 3x + 1$

1.  $y = 1 - x^2$

</Example>
