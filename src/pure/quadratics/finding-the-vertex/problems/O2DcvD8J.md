A farmer is building a pen. The farmer uses $120\text{m}$ of fencing and builds a pen in the following shape:

![Farmer pen](/img/learn/quad-17.svg)

What is the minimum possible area for the interior of the shape, and for what values of $a$ and $b$ does this occur?

---

The perimeter of the shape is $120$

---

The perimeter of the shape is given by the expression
$$
4a + 2b
$$
and the area is given by
$$
a^2 + b^2
$$

---

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
&& 4a + 2b & = 120 \\
\Rightarrow \quad && b & = 60 - 2a
\end{aligned}
$$
Substitute this expression for $b$ into the expression for the area and complete the square.

---

If the minimum area possible is $A$, give the value of
$$
Aab
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are the dimensions for which $A$ occurs.
