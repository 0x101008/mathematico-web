By drawing a suitable sketch, explain why the equation

$$
4x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0
$$

has no real solutions.

::: details Hint

Sketch the parabola

$$
y = 4x^2 - 4x + 5
$$

noting the position of its vertex.

:::

::: details Hint

The coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so we know it is a convex parabola.

:::

::: details Solution

In complete square form, the equation of the parabola is

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = 4 \left[ x^2 - x \right] + 5 \\
& = 4 \left[ \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4} \right] + 5 \\
& = 4 \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - 1 + 5 \\
& = 4 \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 4 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The vertex occurs at $\left( \frac{1}{2}, 4 \right)$. In addition, the parabola
is convex (as the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive) and the $y$-intercept is
$5$.

This enables us to make an accurate sketch

From the sketch, it is clear that no point on the parabola has a $y$ coordinate
of $0$, and so $4x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0$ can have no solutions.
