Express
$$
5x^2 - 2x + 1
$$
in the form
$$
\frac{(ax+b)^2 + c}{5}
$$
where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$

---

After completing the square, you should see the expression
$$
\left(x - \frac{1}{5} \right)^2
$$
If you collect the contents of the bracket into a single fraction, you get
$$
\left( \frac{5x-1}{5} \right)^2
$$
