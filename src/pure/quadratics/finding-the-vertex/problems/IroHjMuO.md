A square-based cuboid is to be formed from pieces of steel tubing and then wrapped in fabric. The total length of steel tubing used is $72\text{m}$.

An engineer draws a diagram to model the situation.

![Cuboid diagram](/img/learn/quad-23.svg)

 1. Show that the total amount, $A$, of fabric required to cover the cuboid is given by
    $$
    A = 72x - 6x^2
    $$

 1. The fabric costs $£7.50\text{ m}^2$. What is the maximum cost of covering the cuboid?

 1. Prove that $A$ achieves its maximum value when the cuboid is a cube.

The total amount of tubing used in the engineer's diagram is
$$
8x + 4y = 64
$$

---

The total surface area of the cuboid is
$$
A = 2x^2 + 4xy
$$
