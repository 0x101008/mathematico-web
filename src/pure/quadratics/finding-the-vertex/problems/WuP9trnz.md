The vertex of the parabola

$$
y = x^2 + 6x + c
$$

lies on the parabola

$$
y = x^2
$$

Find the value of $c$.

<AnswerInput :answer="$frontmatter.answer" />

::: details Hint

In complete square form, we have

$$
y = (x + 3)^2 - 9 + c
$$

:::

::: details Hint

So the vertex is at the point

$$
(-3, c-9)
$$

We are told that these coordinates satisfy $y = x^2$

$$

so the vertex is at the point

$$
(-3, c-9)
$$

We are told that these coordinates satisfy $y = x^2$, therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
c - 9 & = (-3)^2 \\
c & = 18
\end{aligned}
$$
