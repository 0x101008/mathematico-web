At time $t$ seconds, the height of a fighter plane above a radar base is
$$
h = \frac{5}{3}t^2 - 100t + 2000
$$
If the plane's height falls below $475\text{m}$, the plane will be detected by the base.

Determine whether or not the plane is detected.

To remove the $\frac{5}{3}$, you can do
$$
h = \frac{5}{3} \left[ t^2 - 60t \right] + 2000
$$
Now complete the square to find the minimum height of the fighter plane.

Give the minimum height of the plane.
