Define a parabola by
$$
y = (x - 2)(x + 3)
$$
For some choices of $x,$ the value of $y$ is positive, for example:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad & y = 24 > 0 \\
x = -4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad & y = 6 > 0
\end{aligned}
$$
But for other choices of $x,$ we find that $y$ is negative. For example,
$$
x = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -4 < 0
$$
What if we wanted to describe the set of all $x$ such that $y > 0$ ?

The easiest way is to sketch the parabola and look for when $y > 0$ (that is, when the parabola lies *above* the $x$-axis)

Now it is clear that $f(x) > 0$ whenever $x < -3$ or $x > 2.$

Let's see some more examples.

Solve the inequalities

 1. $x^2 + x - 20 < 0$

 1. $4 - 2x - 3x^2 < 0$

 1. $t^2 - 4t - 6 \geq 2t + 1$
