## Notes

Define a parabola by

$$
y = (x - 2)(x + 3)
$$

and let's take a look at a table of values:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
x & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
y & 6 & 0 & -4 & -6 & -6 & -4 & 0 & 6
\end{array}
$$

What if we wanted to describe the set of all $x$ such that $y < 0$? It might
seem clear from the table, but what about $x = -1.5, x = \sqrt{2}$ and all the
other non-integers? We can't check them all!

The easiest way to be sure is to sketch the parabola and look for when $y < 0$
(that is, when the parabola lies below the $x$-axis)

Now it is clear that $y < 0$ whenever $x > -3$ and $x < 2.$

## Example

<Example>

Solve the inequalities

1.  $x^2 + x - 20 < 0$

1.  $4 - 2x - 3x^2 < 0$

1.  $t^2 - 4t - 6 \geq 2t + 1$
