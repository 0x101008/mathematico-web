 1. Prove that the parabola
    $$
    y = x^2 - 4x + 7
    $$
    lies entirely above the $x$-axis

 1. Find the values of $x$ for which points on the parabola lie below the line
    $$
    y = x + 6
    $$

For (b), you need to solve the inequality
$$
x^2 - 4x + 7 < x + 6
$$

If your solution is of the form
 - $\alpha < x < \beta$, give $\alpha^2 + \beta$
 - $\alpha \leq x \leq \beta$, give $\alpha^3 + \beta$
 - $x < \alpha \cup x > \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^2$
 - $x \leq \alpha \cup x \geq \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^3$
