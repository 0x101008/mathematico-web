The equation
$$
2x^2 + qx + q-1 = 0
$$
has exactly two real solutions.

Find the range of possible values of $q$.

$$
b^2 - 4ac > 0
$$

If your solution is of the form
 - $\alpha < q < \beta$, give $\alpha^2 + \beta$
 - $\alpha \leq q \leq \beta$, give $\alpha^3 + \beta$
 - $q < \alpha \cup q > \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^2$
 - $q \leq \alpha \cup q \geq \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^3$
