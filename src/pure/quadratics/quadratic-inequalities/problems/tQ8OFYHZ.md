The line $y = mx$ intersects with the parabola
$$
y = x^2 + 1
$$
Find the possible values of $m.$

---

The equation
$$
x^2 + 1 = mx
$$
has at least one solution.

---

If your solution is of the form
 - $\alpha < m < \beta$, give $\alpha^2 + \beta$
 - $\alpha \leq m \leq \beta$, give $\alpha^3 + \beta$
 - $m < \alpha \cup m > \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^2$
 - $m \leq \alpha \cup m \geq \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^3$
