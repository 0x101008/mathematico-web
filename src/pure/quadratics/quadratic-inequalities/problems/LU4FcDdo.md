A student claims that

 > Given any value of $p \in \mathbb{R}$, there is some $x \neq 4$ such that
 > $$
 > p = \frac{x^2 - 3x}{x - 4}
 > $$

 1. By considering $p = 4$, prove the student is wrong.

 1. Find the range of values of $p$ for which the student's claim fails.

---

For (a), set $p = 4$ and multiply both sides by $x-4$. Use the discriminant.

---

For (b), multiply both sides by $x-4$ to get
$$
x^2 - 3x = p(x-4)
$$
Now collect this into a quadratic in terms of $x$.

This equation is unsolvable exactly for those values of $p$ such that the discriminant is negative.

---

Find the sum of all integer values of $p$ for which the claim fails.
