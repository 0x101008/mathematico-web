Food safety precautions state that, when food is being reheated, it should **either**:
 
 - reach a temperature of above $75^{\circ}\text{C}$ for at least $30$ seconds

 - **or**, reach a maximum core temperature of at least $80^{\circ}\text{C}$

in order to make it safe to eat.

An industrial kitchen models a reheating process using the formula
$$
T = 45 + 2t - \frac{1}{32}t^2, \quad 0 \leq t
$$
where $T$ is the core temperature of the food product, and $t$ is time in seconds.

Determine whether this process should be considered safe, or whether the process needs to be altered.

To see if the first criterion is satisfied, we are interested in solving the inequality
$$
45 + 2t - \frac{1}{32}t^2 > 75
$$

---

To see if the second criterion is satisfied, we need to find the maximum value of
$$
T = 45 + 2t - \frac{1}{32}t^2
$$
We can do this by completing the square, or by considering the symmetry of the parabola.

Let $\delta$ equal the duration for which the temperature of the product is above $75^{\circ}\text{C}$, and let the maximum temperature of the product be $\theta.$

Give the value of $\delta \theta$.
