A rectangle has a width of $k + 2$ and a height of $k - 2,$ where $k$ is a real number.

The area of the rectangle is smaller than or equal to its perimeter.

Find the range of possible values of $k.$

---

The area is
$$
(k+2)(k-2)
$$
and the perimeter is
$$
2(k+2) + 2(k-2)
$$

---

Remember that $k-2$ and $k+2$ are *lengths*, so they must be positive.

---

The solution is of the form
$$
\alpha < k \leq \beta
$$
Give the value of $a+b$ to three significant figures.
