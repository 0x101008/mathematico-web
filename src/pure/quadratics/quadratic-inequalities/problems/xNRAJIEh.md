The quadratic equation

$$
x^2 + kx + 5 = 0
$$

has real roots.

Find the range of possible values of $k.$

If your solution is of the form

- $\alpha < k < \beta$, give $\alpha^2 + \beta$
- $\alpha \leq k \leq \beta$, give $\alpha^3 + \beta$
- $k < \alpha \cup k > \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^2$
- $k \leq \alpha \cup k \geq \beta$, give $\alpha + \beta^3$

to $3$ significant figures.

Real roots means there is at least one solution. Consider the discriminant.
