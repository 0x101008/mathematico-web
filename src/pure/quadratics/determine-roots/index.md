A *root* of a quadratic is any choice of $x$ which solves the equation
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
So when we are finding roots, we are trying to make the quadratic equal to $0.$

---

Amongst the values
$$
x = 2, \quad x = -1, \quad x = 3
$$
which, if any, is a root of the quadratic
$$
y = 3 + 2x - x^2
$$
