Two cars are traveling on a straight section of dual carriageway in parallel, opposite directions. The perpendicular distance between the cars is a constant $4$ meters. Initially, the horizontal distance between the cars is $1 \text{km}$.

Given that each car is traveling at $20 \text{ms}^{-1}$, find the time taken until the actual distance between the cars is first equal to $500 \text{m}$.

After $t$ seconds have passed, notice that each car has traveled $20t$ meters. Let the remaining horizontal distance be called $x$, and the actual distance be $\ell$:

We want to find the $t$ such that $\ell = 50$.

---

Express $x$ in terms of $t$. Notice that $x, \ell$ and $4\text{m}$ form a right angled triangle so that
$$
\ell^2 = x^2 + 4^2
$$
Substitute $\ell = 50$ and solve for $t$.

Give your answer correct to one decimal place.
