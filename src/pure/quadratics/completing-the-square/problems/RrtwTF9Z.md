A cuboid has sides of length $2$, $(x+1)$ and $(x+2)$. Given that the volume of the cuboid is $13$, give the exact lengths of the sides of the cuboid in ascending order.

---

After expressing the information as a quadratic equation, it helps to divide by $2$ so that the coefficient of $x^2$ becomes $1$.

---

The sides $2$ and $x+1$ are very close - you will need to use some ingenuity to decide which one is larger. You can start from the fact that
$$
27 > 25
$$

---

If the sides have lengths $a < b < c$, give the value of
$$
2(a - b^3 + c^3)
$$
