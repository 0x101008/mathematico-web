Factorise the expression

$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
$$

::: details Hint

Think of this as a quadratic in terms of $x$. Then complete the square.

:::

::: details Hint

You can write this in the form

$$
x^2 + 2(y+z)x + y^2 + z^2 + 2yz
$$

before completing the square.

::: details Solution

We'll get it in quadratic form in terms of $x$, then complete the square:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx \\
= {} & x^2 + 2(y+z)x + y^2 + z^2 + 2yz \\
= {} & (x + y + z)^2 - (y + z)^2 + y^2 + 2yz + z^2 \\
= {} & (x + y + z)^2 - y^2 - 2yz - z^2  + y^2 + 2yz + z^2 \\
= {} & (x + y + z)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
