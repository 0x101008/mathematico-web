Factorise the expression
$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
$$
(If you recognise this expression, have a go at factorising it by completing the square, using the method suggested in the hints.)

---

Focus on $x$ as the important variable, and think of this as a quadratic in terms of $x$. Then complete the square.

---

You can write this in the form
$$
x^2 + 2(y+z)x + y^2 + z^2 + 2yz
$$
before completing the square.
