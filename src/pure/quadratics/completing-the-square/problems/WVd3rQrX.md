The quadratic equation
$$
x^2 - 2mx + (2m+5) = 0, \quad m > 0
$$
has exactly two solutions in $x$, and both of these solutions are positive.

Additionally, the larger of the roots is two times larger than the smaller.

 1. Show that
    $$
    8m^2 - 18m - 45 = 0
    $$

 1. Hence, find the value of $m$ and solve the equation
    $$
    x^2 - 2mx + (2m+5) = 0
    $$

Completing the square gives you
$$
(x-m)^2 - m^2 + 2m + 5 = 0
$$
so that
$$
x = m \pm \sqrt{m^2 - 2m - 5}
$$
The roots are therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_0 & = m - \sqrt{m^2 - 2m - 5} \\
x_1 & = m + \sqrt{m^2 - 2m - 5}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $x1 > x0$

Going from the previous hint, you have that
$$
x_1 = 2x_0
$$
Use this to show that
$$
m = 3\sqrt{m^2 - 2m - 5}
$$
and square both sides of the equation.

The roots of the equation in (b) are $x = p$ and $x = q$.

Give the value of
$$
100pq
$$
