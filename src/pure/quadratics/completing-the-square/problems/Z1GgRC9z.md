The complete square form of the quadratic
$$
x^2 + bx + c
$$
is
$$
(x+c)^2 + b
$$
Given that $bc \neq 0$, find the roots of the quadratic.

---

You could complete the square on $x^2 + bx + c$, or you could expand $(x+c)^2 + b$ and compare coefficients.

---

The condition $bc \neq 0$ implies that $b \neq 0$ and $c \neq 0$.

---

In simplest form, the roots are given by
$$
m \pm \sqrt{n}, \quad m,n \in \mathbb{N}
$$
Give the value of $m + n$.
