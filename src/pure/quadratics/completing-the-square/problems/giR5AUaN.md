A ball is dropped from the top of a building of height $63 \text{m}.$ At time $t$ seconds after being dropped, the ball has traveled a distance of
$$
4.9t^2 \, \text{m}
$$
At the same time the ball is dropped, an elevator at the bottom of the building starts to ascend at a constant speed of $0.7\text{ms}^{-1}$.

If the ball and elevator pass each other at time $T$ seconds,

 1. Show that
    $$
    7T^2 + T - 90 = 0
    $$

 1. Hence, use completing the square to show that
    $$
    T = \frac{\sqrt{k} - 1}{14}
    $$
    for some integer $k.$

The distance traveled by the elevator after $t$ seconds will be
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{distance} \, & = \, \text{speed} \, \times \, \text{time} \\
& = 0.7t
\end{aligned}
$$

At the correct moment, the distances traveled by the ball and the elevator must add together to give the height of the building:

To solve
$$
7T^2 + T - 90 = 0
$$
you can divide by $7$ first to get
$$
T^2 + \frac{1}{7}T - \frac{90}{7} = 0
$$
The complete square form then becomes
$$
\left(T - \frac{1}{14} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{14^2} - \frac{90}{7} = 0
$$

Give the value of $k$
