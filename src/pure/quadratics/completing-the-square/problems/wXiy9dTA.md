 1. Expand and simplify
    $$
    (a-b)(a+b)
    $$

 1. Find all pairs of integers $a,b$ that satisfy the equation
    $$
    a^2 - b^2 = 3
    $$

 1. Hence, find all integer values of $n$ such that
    $$
    n^2 - 24n + 147
    $$
    is a square number.

For (b), use part (a) to conclude that
$$
(a-b)(a+b) = 3
$$
Since $3$ can only be written as $3\times 1$ or $-3 \times -1,$ we must have four possible cases:
$$
\begin{aligned}
a - b = 1 \,\, & \text{ and } \, a + b = 3 \\
a - b = 3 \,\, & \text{ and } \, a + b = 1 \\
a - b = -1 \,\, & \text{ and } \, a + b = -3 \\
a - b = -3 \,\, & \text{ and } \, a + b = -1
\end{aligned}
$$
Solve each case to find the possible values of $a$ and the corresponding value of $b$

---

For (c), the value of $n^2 - 24n + 147$ must be square, so let's say it is $m^2$.

You can complete the square to get
$$
(n-12)^2 + 3 = m^2
$$

---

The previous hint rearranges to give
$$
m^2 - (n-12)^2 = 3
$$
and so $(n-12)$ is just like the number $b$ from question (b).

---

Give the product of all possible integer values of $n$.
