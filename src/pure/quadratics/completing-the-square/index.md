We have learned how to factorise a quadratic, but there are some quadratic equations that cannot be solved by factorising, and so we need to learn how to **complete the square**

---

Express each quadratic below in complete square form, and hence find the roots of the quadratic.

 1. $x^2 + 4x + 3$

 1. $x^2 - 6x + 10$

 1. $x^2 + 3x + 5$
