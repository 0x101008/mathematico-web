# {{$frontmatter.title}}

We have learned how to factorise a quadratic, but there are some quadratic
equations that cannot be solved by factorising, and so we need to learn how to
**complete the square**.

This involves taking a quadratic in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ and getting it into
the form

$$
p(x - q)^2 + r
$$

Doing this allows us to solve _any_ quadratic equation, not just ones that can
be easily factorised.

## Example

<Example :id="$frontmatter.vimeo">

Express each quadratic below in complete square form, and hence find the roots
of the quadratic.

1.  $x^2 + 4x + 3$

1.  $x^2 - 6x + 10$

1.  $x^2 + 3x + 5$

</Example>
