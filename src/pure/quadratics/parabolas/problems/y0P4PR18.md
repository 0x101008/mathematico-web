In the equation of the parabola below, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$.

![](/img/learn/quad-27.svg)

The area of the given rectangle is $1458$.

Find the length of the line segment $OP$, giving your answer as a fully
simplified surd in the form

$$
a\sqrt{b}, \quad a,b \in \mathbb{N}
$$

Give the value of $ab$.

::: details Hint

Since the parabola has a single, positive root, it must be of the form

$$
y = (x-k)^2
$$

for some number $k > 0$.

::: details Solution

Since the parabola has a single, positive root, it must be of the form

$$
y = (x-k)^2
$$

for some number $k > 0$.

By symmetry, $P$ must occur when $x = 2k$, and so $y = (2k - k)^2 = k^2$.

Since the area of the rectangle is given, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
2k \times k^2 & = 1458 \\
k^3 & = 729 \\
k & = 9
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we find that $P(18, 81)$ and, by Pythagoras,

$$
\begin{aligned}
OP^2 & = 18^2 + 81^2 \\
& = 9^2(2^2 + 9^2) \\
& = 9^2 \times 85 \\
OP & = 9 \sqrt{85}
\end{aligned}
$$
