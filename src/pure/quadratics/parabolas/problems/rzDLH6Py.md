The parabola with equation
$$
y = 3x^2 + 9x - 30
$$
intersects the $x$-axis at the points $A$ and $B$.

 1. Find the length of the line segment $AB.$

 1. Find the coordinates of the lowest point on the parabola.

---

Find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by solving $3x^2 + 9x - 30 = 0.$

---

Let the length of $AB$ be $\ell$, and the coordinates of the minimum point be $(x,y)$.

Give the value of
$$
16xy\ell
$$
