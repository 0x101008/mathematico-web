Let $p, q > 0$ be real numbers. The triangle formed by the roots and the lowest point on the parabola
$$
y = px^2 - 2pqx
$$
forms an equilateral triangle.

Find the value of $pq$.

---

The factorised form of the parabola's equation is
$$
y = px(x-2q)
$$
This should enable you to find the roots and vertex in terms of $p$ and $q$.

You should definitely draw a diagram!

Here is the diagram

Since the triangle is equilateral, you know that all sides of the triangle are equal.

Therefore, the distance between the roots is equal to the distance from the origin to the vertex.

To make use of this information, you will need Pythagoras.

Give the value of
$$
(pq)^{12}
$$
