The graph of the parabola
$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c
$$
is sketched below:

Find the values of $a,b$ and $c$.

---

Since the $y$ intercept is $2a$, we can replace $c$ with $2a$

---

Since $a$ is a root, we know that
$$
a(a)^2 + b(a) + c = 0
$$
Write something similar for $2a$ and try to solve the equations (you can subtract them).

---

Give the value of
$$
(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)
$$
