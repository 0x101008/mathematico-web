The parabola drawn below has a $y$ intercept of $4$. The roots occur at $x = \alpha$ and $x = \beta$ where $\alpha < 0 < \beta$. The roots and the $y$ intercept form a triangle of area $12$,

You are given that the parabola has the form
$$
y = ax^2 - ax + b
$$

 1. Write down the value of $b$

 1. Explain why $\beta - \alpha = 6$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \alpha + \beta = 1
    $$

 1. Hence, or otherwise, find the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$

---

To find $b$, look at the $y$ intercept, noting that $x=0$ at this point.

---

For (b), consider the formula for the area of a triangle

---

Part (c) is tricky. Since $\alpha,\beta$ are roots of the quadratic, we know that
$$
\begin{aligned}
a\beta^2 - a\beta + 4 & = 0 \\
a\alpha^2 - a\alpha + 4 & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
Try subtracting these equations from each other, and remember that
$$
\beta^2 - \alpha^2 = (\beta - \alpha)(\beta+\alpha)
$$

---

For the last part, we have now shown that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta - \alpha & = 6 \\
\beta + \alpha & = 1
\end{aligned}
$$
Solve these equations to find $\beta$ and $\alpha$

---

Give the value of
$$
80(\alpha^3 + \beta^3)
$$
