A golfer chips a golf ball from ground level. The path of the golf ball follows the shape of a parabola.

![Parabola](/img/learn/quad-9.svg)

As it descends, it just clears the top of a fence. The fence is $2\text{m}$ tall and is at a distance of $8\text{m}$ from the golfer. The ball then travels a further $3\text{m}$ before hitting the ground at the same horizontal level as it was when first struck.

You are given that the path of the ball may be modeled by
$$
h = kx(x-d)
$$
where $h$ is the height of the ball, $x$ is the horizontal distance traveled, and $d,k$ are constants.

 1. Find the values of $d$ and $k$.

 1. Given that the ball just clears a shrub of height $1.5\text{m}$ as it is ascending, find the horizontal distance from the golfer to the shrub.

 1. Find the greatest height reached by the golf ball.

Overall, the diagram for this problem should look like this:

To find $d$, notice that $x=11$ is one of the roots of the parabola.

To find $k$, notice that the point $(8,2)$ lies on the parabola. Substitute this into the equation of the parabola and rearrange.

Let the answers to (b) and (c) be $x$ and $y$. Give the value of
$$
\sqrt{24xy}
$$
