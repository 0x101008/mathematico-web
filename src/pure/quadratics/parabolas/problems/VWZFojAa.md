In the image below, $P$ and $Q$ each have a $y$ coordinate of $3$.

![Triangle drawn in parabola](/img/learn/quad-8.svg)

Given that the parabola has equation
$$
y + 9 = x^2 + 4x
$$
find

 1. the area of the triangle $\triangle PQR$

 1. the perimeter of the triangle $\triangle PQR$

---

To find $P$ and $Q$, set $y = 3$ and solve for $x$.

---

To find the perimeter, you will need to use Pythagoras' Theorem

---

The area is $A$, and the perimeter can be given in the form
$$
p(1 + \sqrt{q})
$$
where $q$ is prime.

Give the value of
$$
Apq
$$
