Find the coefficient of $x$ in the parabola below:

There are two roots. One of them is $0$, and it is most convenient to let the other equal $2b$ for some $b>0$.

Then the equation of the parabola must be of the form
$$
y = ax(2b - x)
$$
for some $a > 0$.

Focus on this triangle first. Try to get $h$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.

Now use this triangle to get $d$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.

Finally, you can use the above hints to find $a$ in terms of $b$. Substitute this in to
$$
y = ax(2b - x)
$$
and rearrange in order to find the coefficient of $x$.
