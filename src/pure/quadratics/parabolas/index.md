If we substitute some numbers into
$$
x^2 - 5x + 6
$$
we could make a table to summarise the results:
$$
\begin{array}{r||c|c|c|c|c|c}
x & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
x^2 - 5x + 6 & 12 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}
$$

If we were to plot the values on an $xy$ plane we get a shape called a parabola:

Here, $A$ and $B$ are the **roots**, and $C$ is the **${y}$ intercept**.

We're going learn to find some of the key points of parabolas.

The roots of the parabola
$$
y = -2x^2 - 6x + 20
$$
are located at $P$ and $Q$.

 1. $R$ is the $y$ intercept of the parabola. Find the area of triangle $PQR$.

 1. $S$ is the vertex of the parabola. Find the area of triangle $PQS$.
