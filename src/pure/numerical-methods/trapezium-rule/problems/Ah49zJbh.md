The curves
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = \sin(2x)+1 \\[1em]
y & = \cos^2(x)
\end{aligned}
$$
are drawn below.

The curves intersect at $P$ and $Q,$ whose $x$ coordinates are $p$ and $q$ respectively.

 1. Show that $p = \pi - \arctan(2)$ and $q = \pi.$

 1. Using the trapezium rule with $5$ strips, approximate
    $$
    \int_{p}^{q} \sin(2x) + 1 \, dx
    $$
    and
    $$
    \int_{p}^{q} \cos^2(x) \, dx
    $$

 1. Hence, find an estimate for the shaded area in the diagram.

Give your estimate for the shaded area to $2$ decimal places.
