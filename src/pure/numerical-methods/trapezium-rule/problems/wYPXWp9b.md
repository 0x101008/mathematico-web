A component for a computer is being designed.

![](/img/learn/trapezium-5.png)

The front face of the component is bound between the horizontal axis and the curve
$$
f(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{4}, \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1
$$
where $x$ is measured in $\text{mm}$. The component is a prism and is $3\text{ mm}$ in length.

Using the trapezium rule with $6$ strips, find an estimate for the volume of the component.

Give the approximate volume of the component, correct to $2$ decimal places.
