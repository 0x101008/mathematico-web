 1. Show that the upper half of the equation of the circle centered at $(0,0)$ and of radius $1$ may be given by the function
    $$
    f(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}, \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1
    $$

 1. By applying the trapezium rule with $6$ strips to
    $$
    \int_{0}^{1} f(x) \, dx
    $$
    find an approximate value for $\pi.$

Give the approximation obtained, to $3$ significant figures.
