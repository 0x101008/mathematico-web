The area bound between $y = 0$ and part of the curve $y = \sin(x)$ is sketched below.

 1. Using the trapezium rule with $6$ strips, find an approximate value for the area indicated.

 1. By drawing a suitable diagram, explain whether this area is an overestimate or an underestimate.

 1. State how the accuracy of the approximation may be improved.

For (a), $h = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2} - 0}{6}$

---

For (b), notice that the trapezia don't quite cover the area they're trying to estimate:

---

This is a much tighter fit between the trapezia and the area:

What have we done here?

---

Give the approximate area, to $3$ significant figures.
