A new electric car is capable of accelerating from $0 \text{ms}^{-1}$ to $27 \text{ms}^{-1}$ in $2.4\text{s}.$

Given below is a sample of its velocities, $v(t)$ meters per second, at time $t$ seconds during its path.

$$
\begin{array}{r|l}
t & v(t) \\ \hline
0 & 0 \\
0.4 & 4.7 \\
0.8 & 9.3 \\
1 & 12 \\
1.3 & 15 \\
1.5 & 17.3 \\
2 & 22.7 \\
2.4 & 27
\end{array}
$$

 1. By forming a Riemann sum of expressions of the form
    $$
    v(t_{i-1}) \Delta t
    $$
    find an estimate for the total distance traveled by the car.

 1. Explain the meaning of the expression
    $$
    \int_{0}^{2.4} v(t) \, dt
    $$
