Nilus runs a blog that reviews computer parts, and she is investigating the effect of temperature, $T$, on the processing speed, $V$, of a CPU.

Nilus discovers that CPU speed (in MHz) decreases as the temperature (in degrees Celsius) increases. The rate of change of CPU speed with respect to temperature is discovered to be
$$
\frac{dV}{dT} = -\frac{1}{2(T+1)} \text{MHz per }^{\circ}\text{C}
$$

 1. By assuming that the rate of change is constant over intervals of width $1^{\circ}\text{C}$, use a Riemann sum to estimate the total loss in processing speed when the computer changes from $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $10^{\circ}\text{C}$.

 1. Given that the CPU performs at $4.5$ MHz in freezing conditions, estimate the speed of the processor when $T = 10^{\circ}\text{C}$

 1. Write an expression, using $\int$ notation, which would give the exact processing speed when $T = 10$

Give your answer to part (b), in $\text{MHz}$, to $2$ decimal places.
