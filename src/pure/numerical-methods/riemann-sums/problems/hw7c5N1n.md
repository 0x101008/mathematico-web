Sand is being poured into a truck for delivery to a building site.

At time $t$, the sand is being poured in at a rate of
$$
20 + 20 \sin\left( \frac{t}{4} - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \text{m}^{3} \text{ per second}, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 12
$$

 1. Let $V$ be the volume of sand in the truck at time $t.$ Complete the table below:

    $$
    \begin{array}{l|l}
    t & \frac{dV}{dt} \\[0.5em] \hline
    0 & 0 \\
    2 & 2.4484 \\
    4 & \\
    6 & \\
    8 & \\
    10 & \\
    12 &
    \end{array}
    $$

 1. Hence, use a Riemann sum to estimate the amount of sand that was poured into the container during the first $12$ seconds.

 1. Given that the truck initially contained $120\text{m}^{3}$ of sand, find the amount of sand in the truck after $12$ seconds.

 1. Write an expression, using $\int$ notation, which represents the exact amount of sand in the truck after $12$ seconds.

Give your answer to (c), in $\text{m}^3$, correct to $3$ significant figures.
