By considering a Riemann sum with $n$ rectangles of equal width:

 1. Show that
    $$
    \int_{0}^{b} x \, dx \approx \frac{b^2}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k - 1)
    $$

 1. Hence, show that
    $$
    \int_{0}^{b} x \, dx \approx \frac{b^2}{2}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)
    $$

 1. Hence, show that
    $$
    \int_{0}^{b} x \, dx = \frac{b^2}{2}
    $$

 1. By sketching
    $$
    y = x, \quad 0 \leq x \leq b
    $$
    explain why the result in part (c) is to be expected.
