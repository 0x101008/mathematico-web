A cylinder of radius $2\text{cm}$ and length $10\text{cm}$ is formed from a metal alloy. The density, $\rho,$ of the cylinder changes along the length of the rod according to the function
$$
\rho(x) = (1.2 + e^{-x}) \, \text{g cm}^{-3}, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 10
$$

A researcher needs a quick estimate for the mass of the rod, and so he splits the rod into $5$ sections of equal width and assumes the density is constant along each section, where the density of the first section is assumed to be $\rho(0)$, and so on.

 1. By forming a Riemann sum, calculate the researcher's estimate.

 1. By sketching $\rho(x),$ explain whether this is an overestimate or an underestimate.

 1. Describe how the estimate might be improved.

 1. Write an expression using $\int$ notation for the actual mass of the cylinder.

Recall that
$$
\text{mass} = \text{density} \times \text{volume}
$$

Suppose the density of the first section is $\rho(0).$ What is the volume? Therefore, what is the mass?

Do the same for the remaining sections.
