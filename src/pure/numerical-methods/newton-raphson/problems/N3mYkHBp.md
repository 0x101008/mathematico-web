The solutions of
$$
x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0
$$
are $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where $\beta > \alpha.$

A researcher is comparing the efficacy of root-finding algorithms, and wants to compare two different methods for approximating $\beta$ using a starting value of $x = 1.6$

 1. Use the quadratic formula to find the exact value of $\beta$
 
 1. Using the iterative formula
    $$
    x_{n+1} = \sqrt{6-2x_n}, \quad x_0 = 1.6
    $$
    find two further approximations for $\beta.$

 1. Use the Newton-Raphson method to find two further approximations, again starting from $x = 1.6$
 
 1. By considering appropriate percentage errors, compare the efficacy of the two methods.

Let $P$ be the percentage error when using the iterative method in (b), and $Q$ be the percentage error when using the Newton-Raphson method in (c).

Give the value of $\frac{P}{Q}$, correct to $1$ significant figure.
