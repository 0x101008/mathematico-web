Note that $\sqrt{2}$ is a solution to the equation
$$
x^2 = 2
$$

 1. Use the change of sign rule to show that
    $$
    1 < \sqrt{2} < \frac{3}{2}
    $$

 1. Show that the Newton-Raphson method, when applied to the equation $x^2 = 2,$ yields the recursive formula
    $$
    x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_{n} + \frac{2}{x_{n}} \right)
    $$

 1. Use a starting value of $x_0 = \frac{3}{2}$ to find two further rational approximations, $x_1$ and $x_2$, for $\sqrt{2}.$

Given that $x_2$ is of the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p,q$ are coprime natural numbers, give the value of $pq$.
