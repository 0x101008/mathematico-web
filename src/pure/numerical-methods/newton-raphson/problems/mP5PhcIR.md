The point $P$ is one of the points of intersection between the curve
$$
y = x^3 + 3x^2 + 1
$$
and the line
$$
y = x + 2
$$

 1. Use the Newton-Raphson method, with a starting value of $x = \frac{3}{4},$ to find $3$ further approximations for the $x$ coordinate of $P.$

 1. Hence, find an approximate value for the $y$ coordinate of $P.$

Give the approximate $y$ coordinate of $P$, to $3$ significant figures.
