The curve
$$
y = e^{2x} - \ln(x)
$$
appears to have a minimum point close to $x = \frac{1}{4}$

 1. Show that the minimum point satisfies
 $$
 2xe^{2x} - 1 = 0
 $$

 1. Hence, use the Newton-Raphson method with a starting value of $x_0 = \frac{1}{4}$ to find two further approximations, $x_1$ and $x_2$, for the $x$ coordinate of the turning point.

Give the value of $x_2$, rounded to $3$ significant figures.
