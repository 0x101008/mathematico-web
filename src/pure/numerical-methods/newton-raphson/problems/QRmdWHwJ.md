 1. Show that the roots of $\sin(x)$ may be approximated by the Newton-Raphson formula
 $$
 x_{n+1} = x_n - \tan(x_n)
 $$

 1. Use this formula, with a starting value of $x_0 = 3,$ to show that
 $$
 \pi \approx 3.142
 $$

Notice that $\sin(\pi) = 0$ so that $\pi$ is a root of $\sin(x) = 0$. We know that $\pi \approx 3$ so this is a good starting value for $x_0$.

Give your second approximation, $x_2$, to $9$ decimal places.
