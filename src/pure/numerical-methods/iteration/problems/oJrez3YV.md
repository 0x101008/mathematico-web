Let
$$
f(x) = x^2 - \tan(x)
$$

 1. Show that the equation
    $$
    f'(x) = 0
    $$
    may be rearranged into the form
    $$
    x = \arccos\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}} \right)
    $$
 
 1. Using a starting value of $x_0 = 2,$ find a fourth approximation, $x_3,$ for the location of one of the stationary points of the curve $y =  f(x).$

 1. By considering $f'(x)$ at $x = x_3$ and $x = x_3 \pm 0.001$ determine whether $x_3$ is an overestimate or an underestimate for the location of the stationary point.

 1. Given that the stationary point is a turning point, state whether this is a maximum or a minimum point of the curve.

Find the value of $x_3$, rounded to $3$ decimal places.

If $x_3$ is an underestimate for the location of the stationary point, multiply this by $13$; otherwise multiply by $17$.

If the turning point is a minimum point, multiply this by $-1$; otherwise do nothing.

Give your answer below.
