The sector $OAB$ contains the triangle $OAB$ and the minor segment $AB.$

 1. Given that the area of the triangle is equal to the area of the segment, show that
    $$
    \frac{\theta}{2} = \sin \theta
    $$

 1. Hence, use iteration with a starting value of $\theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}$ to find three further approximate values, $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$ for $\theta.$

You need to multiply by two first, and use the iterative formula
$$
\theta_{n+1} = 2 \sin(\theta_{n})
$$

---

Give the value of $\theta_3$ to $3$ significant figures.
