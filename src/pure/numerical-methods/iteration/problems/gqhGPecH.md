A curve is given by
$$
y = x^5 - 3x^3 + x^2
$$

 1. Show that
 $$
 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0
 $$
 may be rearranged into the form
 $$
 x = \left( \frac{9x-1}{10} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
 $$

 1. Hence, use an iterative method with a starting value of $x_0 = \frac{1}{4}$ to find three further approximations for the location of one of the points of inflection of the curve.
