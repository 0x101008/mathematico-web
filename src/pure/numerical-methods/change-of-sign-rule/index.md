The *change of sign* rule is a rather simple idea. If we are given a continuous function $f(x)$ and we know that, for some numbers $a < b,$
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(a) & < 0 \\
f(b) & > 0
\end{aligned}
$$
then we must have $f(x) = 0$ at some point $a < x < b.$

Looking at a picture makes this clear:

If $f(a)$ is negative and $f(b)$ is positive, there must be a root somewhere in-between. (This, of course, also works if $f(a)>0$ and $f(b)<0.$

The condition that $f$ is continuous is important, as you will see in the problems. For now, though, let's get used to using the change of sign rule.

 1. Show that, for some $x$ where $0.8 \leq x \leq 1.0,$ the line
    $$
    y = 3 x - 2
    $$
    and the curve
    $$
    y = \cos{\left(x \right)}
    $$
    intersect.

 1. By using a suitable interval, determine the $x$ coordinate of the point of intersection correct to $2$ significant figures.
