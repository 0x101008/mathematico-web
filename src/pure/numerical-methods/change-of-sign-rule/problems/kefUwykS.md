A curve $C$ is given by
$$
y = x \cos x, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
$$
You are given that $C$ has no stationary inflection points.

 1. Show that the curve experiences a turning point for some $x$ where $0.8 < x < 0.9.$ Use your working to explain whether this is a minimum or a maximum point. (You are given that there is only one turning point between $x = 0.8$ and $x = 0.9.$)

 1. Show that $x = 0$ is a point of inflection of $C$. Show further that $C$ has another point of inflection for some $x$ where $2.2 < x < 2.3.$

Give the coordinates of the second point of inflection, correct to $3$ significant figures.
