A student is considering the curve $y = \frac{1}{x}.$ Here is their working:

 > Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}.$ Then
 > $$
 > \begin{aligned}
 > f(-0.1) & = -10 \\
 > f(0.1) & = 10
 > \end{aligned}
 > $$
 > Since there is a change of sign, $f$ has a root for some $-0.1 < x < 0.1.$

 1. Which condition on the change of sign rule has the student forgotten?

 1. Explain, by sketching $y = \frac{1}{x},$ why the student is wrong.
