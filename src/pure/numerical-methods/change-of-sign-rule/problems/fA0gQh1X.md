A student's working is shown below.

 > Consider the curve
 > $$
 > y = \frac{199 e^{x^{2}} - 200}{ 200 e^{x^{2}} }
 > $$
 > Let $y = f(x)$. We have
 > $$
 > \begin{aligned}
 > f(-0.1) & = 0.0049502 \\
 > f(0.1) & = 0.0049502
 > \end{aligned}
 > $$
 > Since both values are positive, the curve has no roots between $-0.1$ and $0.1$.

 1. Give a simple counter-example to demonstrate that the student's reasoning is not generally true.

 1. By considering the value of $f$ on some other interval, prove that $f$ does, in fact, have a root within $-0.1 < x < 0.1.$

---

For (a), something like $y = x^2 - 4$ would work, so long as you explain why this is a counter-example.

---

For (b), try $f(0).$

---

Give the root of $f$ correct to $2$ decimal places.
