 1. Show that the first derivative of $2^{x^2}$ is 

 1. Show that the curve
    $$
    y = 2^{x^2} - 3x
    $$
    has a turning point in the region
    $$
    1 < x < 1.1
    $$

 1. By choosing a suitable interval, determine, correct to $2$ decimal places, the $x$ coordinate of the turning point.

Differentiating $2^{x^2}$ is a little tricky.

Try this:
$$
\begin{aligned}
u & = 2^{x^2} \\
\ln(u) & = \ln(2^{x^2}) \\
\ln(u) & = x^2 \ln(2) \\
$$
Then use implicit differentiation to find $\frac{du}{dx}$.

To locate the turning point, you need to consider
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
$$
