The curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x = t^2 \cos(t) \\
y = 2t \sin(t)
\end{aligned}
$$
Show that there is some value of $t$, where $\frac{12\pi}{25} < t < \frac{\pi}{2},$ such that the gradient of the curve is equal to $-1.$

The gradient of the curve is given by
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dt} \frac{dt}{dx}
$$
