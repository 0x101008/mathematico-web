The word *translation* in mathematics does not mean to change the language of something, but there is maybe some similarity in the meaning. When we *translate* a shape, we change its position (i.e. we move it) but without changing its size, shape or rotating it.

In this chapter, we will learn about how to translate the graph, $y = f(x)$, of a function $f$ by changing the expression for $f.$ We will see this same idea many times in the rest of the course, so let's get going and learn all about it!

 1. Complete the tables below:
    $$
    \begin{array}{r||c|c|c|c|c|c}
    x & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
    x^2 & & & & & & \\ \hline
    (x+1)^2 & & & & & &
    \end{array}
    $$
    $$
    \begin{array}{r||c|c|c|c|c|c}
    x & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
    x^2 & & & & & & \\ \hline
    x^2 + 1 & & & & & &
    \end{array}
    $$
    Sketch each curve. What do you notice?

 1. Let $f(x) = x^3.$

    Sketch the curves
    $$
    y = f(x + 3) - 2 \quad \text{ and } \quad y = f(x - 1) + 3
    $$
