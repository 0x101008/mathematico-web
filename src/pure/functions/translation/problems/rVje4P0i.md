Below is a sketch of
$$
y = \frac{3x+2}{x^2+x}
$$

 1. Express the equation of the curve in partial fractions

 1. Hence, or otherwise, sketch the curve
    $$
    y = \frac{2}{x-1} + \frac{1}{x} - 1
    $$

Write
$$
\frac{3x+2}{x^2+x} = \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1}
$$
to find the partial fraction decomposition. Don't forget there's a tutorial on partial fractions so you can head there to refresh your memory if needed!

What is the relationship between the decomposition you found in part (a) and the curve we are now asked to sketch?

To find the horizontal translation needed, think about replacing $x$ with $x + a$ for some $a.$
