Let $f(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1$ with domain $x \geq -2,$ and define $g(x) = f(x - 5) + 3.$

 1. State the range of $f.$

 1. State a suitable domain for $g$ and give its range.

 1. Find expressions for
    $$
    f^{-1}(x) \quad \text{ and } g^{-1}(x)
    $$
    and sketch these two functions.

---

Sketch $y = f(x)$ to find its range.

---

Translate $y = f(x)$ to get a sketch of $y = g(x)$ - look at the $x$ axis to find the domain and the $y$ axis to find the range.

Take a look at the tutorial for inverse functions in this chapter if you're finding the last part tricky!
