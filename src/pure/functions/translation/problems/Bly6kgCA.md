Let $f$ and $g$ be defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & = |x| \\
g(x) & = x - 1
\end{aligned}
$$
Sketch the curve
$$
y = g(f(g(x)))
$$

---

By composition of functions,
$$
g(f(g(x))) = |x - 1| - 1
$$

---

Start with sketching $|x|.$ You can get the sketch of $y = |x-1| - 1$ by translating $y = |x|$ by the appropriate amount.
