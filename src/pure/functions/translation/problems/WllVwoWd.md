The graph shows the parabolas
$$
y = f(x) \quad \text{ and } \quad y = g(x)
$$

Given that $g(x)$ is a translation of $f(x),$ find an expression for $g(x).$

If you know an expression for $f(x)$, you can then find $g(x).$ Look at the location of the vertices to find how much to translate $f$ by, both horizontally and vertically, to get $g.$

Since the curve $y = f(x)$ is a parabola, $f(x)$ is a quadratic, so it has the form
$$
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
$$
We know that $(-6,0), (-3, -9)$ and $(0,0)$ lie on $y = f(x)$ and so we can substitute this information into $y = f(x)$ to find $a, b$ and $c$ - thus, we find an expression for $f(x).$
