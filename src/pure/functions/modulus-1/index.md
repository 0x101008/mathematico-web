If $x$ is a real number, then its *modulus*, $|x|,$ gives the *size* of the number. If $x$ is already positive, nothing happens, but if $x$ is negative, it gets made positive.

For example,
$$
\begin{aligned}
|7| & = 7 \\
|-4| & = 4
\end{aligned}
$$

$|x|$ is sometimes called the *magnitude* of $x,$ and it is also sometimes called the *absolute value* of $x.$

In this tutorial, we will learn how to sketch functions and solve equations that involve absolute values.

The function $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = \left| 1 - \frac{x}{2} \right|
$$

 1. Find $f(0), f(2)$ and $f(4)$

 1. Sketch the curve $y = f(x).$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    \left| 1 - \frac{x}{2} \right| = 3
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    \left| 1 - \frac{x}{2} \right| = 2x
    $$
