The equation
$$
|3 - x| = \frac{x + k}{2}
$$
has exactly two solutions.

Find the range of possible values of $k.$

By considering the diagram above, you can see that $k$ controls the vertical position of the line
$$
y = \frac{x+k}{2}
$$
If you can find the critical value which causes there to be exactly one solution, then you can find the range of values for which there are two solutions.
