A student is attempting to solve the equation
$$
\left| \frac{x}{2} + 3 \right| = x
$$

Here is their working:

> The first solution is given by
> $$
> \frac{x}{2} + 3 = x \Rightarrow x = 6
> $$
> and the second is given by
> $$
> -\frac{x}{2} - 3 = x \Rightarrow x = -2
> $$
> so the solutions are
> $$
> x = 6, \quad x = -2
> $$

 1. Prove, by substituting the solutions back into the original equation, that the student is wrong.

 1. Explain, by drawing a diagram, why the student's working is incorrect.
