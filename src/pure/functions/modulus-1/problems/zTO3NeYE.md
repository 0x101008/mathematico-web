The line $\ell_1$ passes through the point $(-4,0)$ and has gradient $m.$

$\ell_1$ intersects the curve
$$
y = |x^2 - 2|
$$
in exactly three points.

Given that $m$ is of the form $a - b\sqrt{c}$ where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{N},$ find the exact value of $m.$

Try moving $m$ around in the picture above.

It suggests there is a value of $m$ between $0.5$ and $0.6$ where we have exactly three points of intersection.

Because we know $(x_0, y_0) = (-4, 0)$ lies on the line, the equation of the line can be expressed, using the point-slope formula, as
$$
y - 0 = m(x - - 4)
$$
Simplify this before using it.

The key is to make sure $y = 2 - x^2$ (that's the $n$-shaped part of the parabola) and the line $y = mx + 4m$ intersect exactly once.

Use the discriminant.
