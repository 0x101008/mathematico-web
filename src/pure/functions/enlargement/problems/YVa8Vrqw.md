The point $A(3,2)$ lies on the curve $y = f(x).$

 1. Find the coordinates to which $A$ is transformed on the curves $y = f(3x)$ and $y = 4f(x).$

 1. Given that $A$ transforms to the point $(12, 10)$ on the curve $y = af(bx),$ find the values of $a$ and $b.$

For part (b), observe that $3$ has enlarged by a scale factor of $4$ to become $12$. What transformation to $y = f(x)$ would cause this? This line of thought should help you find $b.$
