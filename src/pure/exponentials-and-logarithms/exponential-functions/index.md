An example of an exponential function is
$$
f(x) = 3^x
$$
We say that the *base* of the exponential function is $3.$

Here are a few key values of the function:
$$
\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|c|c}
x & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
f(x) & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{3} & 1 & 3 & 9
\end{array}
$$
In this tutorial, we will learn how to sketch exponential curves like $y = 3^x$ and deal with some types of exponential equations.

On the same set of axes, sketch the curves
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = 3 \times 3^x \\
y & = \frac{\sqrt{3^x}}{3} \\
y & = 1 - \frac{1}{3^x}
\end{aligned}
$$
