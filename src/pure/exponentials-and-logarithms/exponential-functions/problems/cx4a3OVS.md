A graphics artist needs to find the area of the shape formed between the curve
$$
y = \left( \frac{5}{4} \right)^x
$$
and the straight lines
$$
x = 0, \quad x = 10, \quad y = 0
$$

In order to do this, she splits the shape up into $10$ rectangles, as below:

 1. Find the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

 1. This estimate is not accurate enough for the artist, and so she instead splits the shape into $20$ rectangles: ![Curve with more rectangles](/img/learn/exp-3.svg) Find the new estimate for the area of the shape.
