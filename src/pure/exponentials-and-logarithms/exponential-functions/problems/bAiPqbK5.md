The curve
$$
y = \lambda a^x, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
$$
where $a > 0,$ passes through the points
$$
(2, 18) \quad \text{and} \quad (4, 162)
$$
Find the values of $a$ and $\lambda.$

---

Substitute the points into the curve to form two simultaneous equations.

---

Try dividing the equations to eliminate $\lambda.$
