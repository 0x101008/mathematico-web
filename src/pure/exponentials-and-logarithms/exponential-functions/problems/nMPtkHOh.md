The function $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = 8^x - 7 \times 4^x + 7 \times 2^{x+1} - 8
$$
Below, the curve $y = f(x)$ is sketched:

![Given curve](/img/learn/exp-5.svg)

Find the coordinates of all points of intersection between $C$ and the $x$ axis.

---

$$
8^x = \left(2^x\right)^3
$$
and
$$
4^x = \left(2^x\right)^2
$$

---

$$
7 \times 2^{x+1} = 14 \times 2^x
$$

This is a cubic in disguise! Let $u = 2^x$. You have a factor so you can use long division.
