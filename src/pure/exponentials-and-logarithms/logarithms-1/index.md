We don't need any special methods to see that
$$
\begin{aligned}
2^x = 4 \Rightarrow x = 2 \\
2^x = 8 \Rightarrow x = 3
\end{aligned}
$$

But what about the equation
$$
2^x = 6
$$

![2^x with points](/img/learn/exp-7.svg)

We can see from the graph that there should be an answer around $x \approx 2.6$ or so. So how do we find $x$?

What we need is an inverse function! If $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = 2^x, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
$$
then the solution to
$$
f(x) = 6
$$
is
$$
x = f^{-1}(6)
$$
This is where logarithms come in, as we will see in the next example.

Use logarithms to solve the following equations, giving your answers to $3$ significant figures where necessary.

 1.

 $$
 2^x = 8
 $$

 1.

 $$
 2^x = 7
 $$

 1.

 $$
 3^x = \frac{1}{27}
 $$

 1.

 $$
 5^{2x+1} = 100
 $$
