A geometric sequence begins
$$
2, \, 6, \, 18, \, \ldots
$$

 1. Find the position of the first term in the sequence which is larger than
    $$
    100,000
    $$

 1. Find smallest number of terms required for the sum
    $$
    2 + 6 + 18 + \ldots
    $$
    to exceed
    $$
    1,000,000
    $$

The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a geometric sequence is given by
$$
u_n = ar^{n-1}
$$

---

You need to find the smallest $n \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying
$$
2 \times 3^{n-1} > 100,000
$$
