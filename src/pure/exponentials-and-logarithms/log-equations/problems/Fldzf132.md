The functions $c(x)$ and $s(x)$ are defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
c(x) & = \frac{2^x + 2^{-x}}{2} \\
s(x) & = \frac{2^x - 2^{-x}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. Show that $c(x)$ is an even function and $s(x)$ is an odd function.

 1. Show that
    $$
    s(2x) = 2s(x)c(x)
    $$

 1. Show that
    $$
    c(x)^2 - s(x)^2 = 1
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    c(x)^2 - s(x) = 1, \quad x > 0
    $$
    giving your solution in the form
    $$
    \log_2(a + \sqrt{b})
    $$

For (a), remember that a function $f$ is even if you can show that $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$.

Similarly, to show a function is odd we need to show that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$.

---

For (b), work out the left hand side and the right hand side separately and conclude that they are the same.

---

For (c), start with the left hand side.

---

For(d), use part (c) to change $c(x)^2$ into something in terms of $s(x)^2$.

---

For your solution to (d), give the value of
$$
(a+2)(b+2)
$$
