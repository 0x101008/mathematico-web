Solve the equation
$$
3^{\log\left( x^2 \right) - 1} = 4 \times 3^{\log(x)} - 9
$$

---

The left hand side
$$
3^{\log\left( x^2 \right) - 1}
$$
can be expressed as
$$
\frac{3^{2\log(x)}}{3}
$$

---

Again, working on the left hand side, this can be further expressed as
$$
\frac{[3^{\log(x)}]^2}{3}
$$
making the whole equation a quadratic in disguise! (Let $u = 3^{\log(x)}$)

Give the (positive) difference between the solutions.
