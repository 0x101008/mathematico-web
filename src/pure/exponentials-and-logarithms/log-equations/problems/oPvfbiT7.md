Solve the equation
$$
2 + \log_{2}(\cos \theta) = \frac{1}{2} \log_{2}(3) - \log_{2}( \sin \theta), \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi
$$

---

Recall that
$$
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta
$$

---

Once you have your solutions, you need to select only the ones where both $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$ are positive, so that $\log(\cos \theta)$ and $\log(\sin \theta)$ are defined.

---

The product of the solutions can be expressed as $\frac{\pi^n}{m}$ for $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$.

Give the value of
