The sketch below shows the curves
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = 2^{\sin x} \\
y & = 3^{\cos x}
\end{aligned}
$$

![Two curves and six points](/img/learn/exp-8.svg)

Find the coordinates of the labeled points, giving your answers to $3$ significant figures where appropriate.

---

At $A$ and $B$, $x = 0$.

---

At $C$ and $D$, we must solve
$$
2^{\sin(x)} = 3^{\cos(x)}
$$

---

To find $E$, we need to make $2^{\sin(x)}$ as large as possible. What values can $\sin(x)$ take?
