There are several important techniques that allow us to solve equations using logarithms.

An essential thing to know is that whenever you see $\log$ written without a base, it is implied that the base is $10,$ so $\log(x)$ just means $\log_{10}(x).$

You probably have a button on your calculator with just 'log' on it, so this means $\log_{10}.$ The reason for this is that some equations can be solved by taking $\log$ of both sides, as we will see next.

Solve the equations

 1. $$
    \log_{2}(x+5) - \log_2(x - 5) = -3
    $$

 1. $$
    \log(x + 2) + 2\log(2) + \log(5)
    $$
