There are two more laws of logarithms which we need to be able to use.

There is the **addition law**:
$$
\log_a(x) + \log_a(y) = \log_a(xy)
$$
and the **subtraction law**
$$
\log_a(x) - \log_a(y) = \log_a \left( \frac{x}{y} \right)
$$
It is important to note that we can't directly use these laws if the functions have a coefficient in front. For example,
$$
2 \log(5) - 3 \log(3)
$$
needs to first be changed, using the power law, into
$$
\log(5^2) - \log(3^3)
$$
Now we can use the subtraction law:
$$
\log \left( \frac{25}{27} \right)
$$
Let's see some more examples!

 1. Assuming $x > 0$, simplify
    $$
    2 \log_4 \left( \sqrt{x} \right) - 3 \log_4 \left( \sqrt{x} \right)
    $$
 
 1. Express
    $$
    \log_u \left( \frac{u}{\sqrt{v}w^3} \right)
    $$
    in terms of $\log_v(u)$ and $\log_v(w)$.
