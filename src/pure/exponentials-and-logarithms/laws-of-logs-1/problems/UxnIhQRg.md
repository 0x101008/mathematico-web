A student is trying to solve the equation
$$
2 \times 3^{2x+1} = 10
$$
Here is the student's working:

 > $$
 > \begin{aligned}
 > 2 \times 3^{2x+1} & = 10 \\
 > \log\left( 2 \times 3^{2x+1} \right) & = \log(10) \\
 > \left( 2x + 1 \right) \log( 2 \times 3 ) & = 1 \\
 > 2x + 1 & = \frac{1}{\log(6)} \\
 > x & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{\log(6)} - 1 \right)
 > \end{aligned}
 > $$


 1. Explain the student's mistake.

 1. Give the correct answer to $3$ significant figures.

The error occurs going from line 2 to line 3 in the working.
