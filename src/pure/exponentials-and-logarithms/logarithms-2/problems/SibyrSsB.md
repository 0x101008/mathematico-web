 1. Sketch the curve
    $$
    y = \log_2(x)
    $$
    giving the coordinates of any point of intersection with the coordinate axes.

 1. Show that
    $$
    \log_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) = - \log_{2}(x)
    $$
    and hence sketch the curve
    $$
    y = \log_{\frac{1}{2}}(x)
    $$

---

For part (a), note that $\log_2(x)$ is the inverse function of $2^x.$

---

For part (b), write
$$
y = \log_{\frac{1}{2}}(x)
$$
and rearrange to show that
$$
y = - \log_{2}(x)
$$

---

To sketch $y = -f(x),$ we reflect $y = f(x)$ in the $x$ axis.
