For each $n \in \mathbb{N},$ let $d_n$ be the last digit of the number $2^n$.

 1. Given that $d_n, \, n \in \mathbb{N}$ is a periodic sequence, give its period.

 1. Prove that
    $$
    \log_2(10)
    $$
    is irrational.

---

For (a), list the first few values of the sequence $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \ldots$ and spot the pattern in the last digit

---

For (b), use proof by contradiction. Suppose that $\log^2(10) = \frac{m}{n}$ is rational.

---

Rearrange $\log^2(10) = \frac{m}{n}$ to show that $2^n = 10^m$. Why is this impossible? (Consider part (a))
