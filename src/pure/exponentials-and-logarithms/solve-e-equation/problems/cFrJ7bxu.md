 1. Sketch, on the same set of axes, the curves
    $$
    y = 2\left| \ln(x) \right|
    $$
    and
    $$
    y = \ln(x+1)
    $$

 1. Find the value of $x > 1$ for which these curves intersect.

 1. By considering the other point of intersection, show that the cubic equation
    $$
    x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0
    $$
    has a real root between $0$ and $1$ (you do not need to calculate this root).

For (a), remember that $x \mapsto \ln(x)$ is the inverse function of $x \mapsto e^x$. To sketch an inverse function you need reflect in the line $y = x$.

Now, to get $y = \ln(x+1)$, consider this as a transformation of the curve $y = \ln(x)$.

The answer to (b) can be expressed in the form
$$
\frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}
$$
where $a,b,c$ are coprime. Give the value of
$$
a + b + c
$$
