A pastry chef is heating a sugar syrup in order to make a tart glaze.

The temperature, $\theta^{\circ} \text{C}$, of the syrup after $t$ minutes can be modeled by the function
$$
\theta = 108 - 90 e^{\mu t}, \quad t \geq 0
$$
where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is a constant.

 1. Write down the initial temperature of the syrup.

 1. The syrup must be removed from the heat when it has reached at least $104^{\circ}{\text{C}}$ and at most $106^{\circ}{\text{C}}$. Given that it takes $4$ minutes for the syrup to reach $100^{\circ} \text{C}$, how long does the temperature of the syrup remain in the required range?

For (b), the key is to find the value of $\mu$ by substituting $\theta = 100, t = 4$ into the model.

Give your answer to (b) in **seconds**, correct to $3$ significant figures.
