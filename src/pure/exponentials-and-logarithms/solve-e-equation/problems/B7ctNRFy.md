 1. Sketch the curve
    $$
    y = |2e^x - 4|
    $$
    indicating the coordinates of any intersections with the axes, and the equations of any asymptotes.

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    |2e^x - 4| = 3
    $$

Start by sketching $y = 2e^x$, then $y = 2e^x - 4$, then $y = |2e^x - 4|$.

If the roots are $\alpha$ and $\beta$, then $|\beta - \alpha|$ can be expressed as
$$
\ln(k)
$$
where $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is prime. Give the value of $k$.
