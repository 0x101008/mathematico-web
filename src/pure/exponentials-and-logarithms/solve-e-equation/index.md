Below is a plot of the curve $y = 2^x$ with the tangent to the curve drawn.

If you look closely, you will see that the gradient of the tangent is smaller than the $y$ coordinate of the point. That is, the gradient of the tangent is smaller than $2^x.$

Here is $y = 3^x,$ and if you look carefully you will see that the gradient is always larger than $3^x$:

This suggests there should be a number between $2$ and $3$ where the gradient is always equal to the value of the function.

This number is called $e,$ and
$$
e \approx 2.71828183
$$
Here are some facts about $e$:

 -  $e$ is an irrational number

 -  The gradient of $y = e^x$ is equal to $e^x$, as you can see below:

 -  When we take a logarithm with base $e,$ instead of $\log_{e}(x)$ we usually write
    $$
    \ln(x)
    $$
    The $n$ stands for "natural," and we call this *the natural logarithm*

 -  $e$ was first discovered in the context of lending money with interest, as you can read about [here](/blog/200724-the-number-e)

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    2^xe^{2x} = e^5
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    \ln(x+1) - \ln(x-1) = 2
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    \ln(x+2) + \ln(2x + 1) = \ln(5)
    $$
