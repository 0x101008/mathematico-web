title: Integrating $\sin^2$ and $\cos^2$
problems:
---

When calculating
$$
\int \cos^2 x \, dx
$$
we need to remember that
$$
\cos 2x = 2\cos^2 x - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}
$$
which allows us to turn the $\cos^2 x$ into something we can integrate.

Something very similar works for integrating $\sin^2 x$, as we'll see in the examples.

Find the following integrals:

 1. $$
    \int \cos^2(x) \, dx
    $$

 1. $$
    \int \sin^2(x) \, dx
    $$

 1. $$
    \int \sin^2 (2x) - \cos^2 \left( \frac{x}{3} \right) \, dx
    $$
