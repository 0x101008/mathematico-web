Recall that a curve can be defined parametrically. For example
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = \cos(t) \\
y & = \sin(2t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose we wanted to find the area under one of the arches of the curve:

One approach could be to eliminate $t$, and find the Cartesian equation of the curve in the form $y = f(x),$ and then integrate as normal. However, this is sometimes inconvenient. As we will see, parametric integration can save us a lot of work.

The curve below is given by the parametric equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = \cos(t) \\
y & = \sin(2t)
\end{aligned}
$$
