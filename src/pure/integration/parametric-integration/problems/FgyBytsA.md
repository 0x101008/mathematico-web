The curve below is given by the parametric equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = \sin(2t) \\
y & = \sin(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The points $P$ and $Q$ lie on the curve and additionally satisfy $y = |x|$.

The tangents to the curve at $P$ and $Q$ are drawn, and the shaded area is enclosed between the curve and the tangents.

Find the exact value of the shaded area.

The area can be given in the form $\frac{a}{b}$.

Give the value of $ab$.
