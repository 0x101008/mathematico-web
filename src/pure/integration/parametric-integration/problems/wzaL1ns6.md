The image below shows part of a curve given by the parametric equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & = 3t^2 \\
y & = 2t^2 - 4t
\end{aligned}
$$

Find the coordinates of $Q$ by setting $y = 0$.

Find the coordinates of $P$ by setting $y = 6$.

You will have to think about which values of $t$ and $x$ actually give you $P$ and $Q$, as the above equations will give you more than one possibility.
