If we were to calculate

$$
\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 - 1 \, dx
$$

we would get an answer of

$$
\left[ \frac{x^3}{3} - x \right]_{x=-1}^{x=1} = -\frac{4}{3}
$$

The negative might surprise you.

However, the integral $\int_{a}^{b} f'(x) \, dx$ represents the total change in
$y=f(x)$ as $x$ goes from $a$ to $b,$ and so if $f(x)$ is decreasing it makes
sense that the total change should be negative.

If the question were asked differently, e.g. _find the finite area bound between
the curve $y = x^2 - 1$ and the $x$ axis_, then we would give our answer as
$\left|-\frac{4}{3} \right| = \frac{4}{3}$. This will be made more clear in the
next example.

Part of the curve

$$
y = -x^{3} + 11 x^{2} - 34 x + 24
$$

is sketched below:
