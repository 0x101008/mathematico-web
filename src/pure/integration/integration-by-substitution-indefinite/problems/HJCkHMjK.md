 1. Show that
    $$
    \frac{\cos x}{(1-\sin x)(1+\sin x)} = \sec x
    $$

 1. Using the substitution $u = 1 - \sin x,$ show that
    $$
    \int \sec x \, dx = \int \frac{1}{u(u-2)} \, du
    $$ 


 1. Use the method of partial fractions to show that
    $$
    \int \sec x \, dx = \ln|\sec x + \tan x| + c
    $$

If $u = 1 - \sin(x),$ what is $2 - u$?

You should get to the point where you have
$$
\frac{1}{2} \ln\left| \frac{1 + \sin x}{1 - \sin x} \right|
$$
Try and multiply the fraction on top and bottom by $1 + \sin(x),$ and remember that
$$
k \ln(x) = \ln(x^k)
$$
