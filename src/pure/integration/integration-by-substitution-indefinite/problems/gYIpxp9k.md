Using the substitution $x = u^6,$ find
$$
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt[3]{x}} \, dx
$$

---

$$
x = u^6 \Rightarrow \frac{dx}{du} = 6u^5
$$
so that
$$
dx = 6u^5 du
$$

---

You should get
$$
6 \int \frac{u^3}{u+1} \, du
$$
Try using the substitution
$$
v = u + 1
$$
to do this.

At the end of the problem, you need to change $v$ back into $u$ and then $u$ back into $x$
