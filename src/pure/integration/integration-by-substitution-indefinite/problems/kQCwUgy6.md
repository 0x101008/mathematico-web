Let
$$
f(x) = \sec(x)
$$
Find
$$
\int f'(x)^2 \, dx
$$

---

Note that
$$
f'(x) = \sec(x)\tan(x)
$$
so you're trying to find
$$
\int \sec^2(x) \tan^2(x) \, dx
$$

---

Write it like this
$$
\int \left[ \tan(x) \right]^2 \sec^2(x) \, dx
$$
and remember that $\frac{d}{dx} \tan(x) = \sec^2(x)$

---

Try the substitution
$$
u = \tan(x)
$$
