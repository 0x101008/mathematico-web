Let
$$
I = \int e^x \cos(x)
$$

 1. Use integration by parts to show that
    $$
    2I = e^x(\sin(x) + \cos(x))
    $$

 1. Hence, find the equation of the curve which passes through the origin and satisfies
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = e^x \cos(x)
    $$
    giving your answer in the form
    $$
    y = R e^x \sin(x+\alpha) + c
    $$
    where $R>0$ and $0 < \alpha < \frac{pi}{4}.$
