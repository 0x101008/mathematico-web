 1. Suppose $5$ points are chose from the $xy$-plane whose coordinates are all integers.

    Prove that, among all possible pairs of points, at least one pair must have the property that their midpoint also has integer coordinates.

 1. What is the minimum number of points in three dimensions required for the same property to necessarily hold?
