The **double angle formulae** allow us to calculate
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(2A) & = 2 \sin(A) \cos(A) \\[1em]
\cos(2A) & = \cos^2(A) - \sin^2(A) \\[1em]
\tan(2A) & = \frac{2\tan(A)}{1 - \tan^2(A)}
\end{aligned}
$$
This is really just an application of the addition formulae that we've already learned, as we'll see in the first example.

A brief note about $\cos(2A)$. Because $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1,$ we can get alternative forms of the double angle formula for $\cos$ as so
$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos(2A) & = \cos^2(A) - \sin^2(A) \\[1em]
& = 2 \cos^2(A) - 1 \\[1em]
& = 1 - 2\sin^2(A)
\end{aligned}
$$
These can be supremely useful (as will be explained in the first example).

 1. Given that $\cos x = \frac{1}{2}$ for acute $x$, find the value of $\sin(2x)$.

 1. Given that $\cos \theta = 0.9$ find the value of $\cos 2\theta$.
