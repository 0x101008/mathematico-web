 1. Show that
    $$
    \cos 2 \theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta
    $$
    and hence prove that
    $$
    \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{8} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}
    $$

 1. Show that
    $$
    \cos 2 \theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1
    $$
    and hence find the exact value of
    $$
    \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \right)
    $$

For (a), we have
$$
\cos 2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta
$$
and also
$$
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$

Substitute $\theta = \frac{\pi}{8}$ into the identity
$$
\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta
$$
and remember that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$
