 1. By considering
    $$
    \sin(A + B)
    $$
    when $A = x$ and $B = x,$ show that
    $$
    \sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x
    $$

 1. By considering
    $$
    \cos(A + B)
    $$
    when $A = x$ and $B = x,$ show that
    $$
    \cos(2x) = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x
    $$

 1. Prove, additionally, that
    $$
    \cos(2x) = 2\cos^2 x - 1
    $$
    and
    $$
    \cos(2x) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 x
    $$

For (a), start with
$$
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
$$
Let $A = x$ and $B = x$.

---

For (b), start with
$$
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B
$$

---

For (c), recall that in (b), we showed that
$$
\cos(2x) = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x
$$
But we also know that
$$
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1
$$
and this can be used to eliminate either $\sin^2$ or $\cos^2$ from the double angle formula for $\cos.$
