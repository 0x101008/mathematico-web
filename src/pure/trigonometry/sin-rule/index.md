Consider a general triangle, labeled in the usual way:

The sine rule states that
$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$
These equations allow us to deal with problems which involve a pair of angles and their opposite sides.

Conveniently, the terms in the rule can be reciprocated to give
$$
\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}
$$
which can save us a line or two of working.
