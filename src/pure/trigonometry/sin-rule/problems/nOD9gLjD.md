The triangle below has angles $\lambda, \, 2\lambda$ and $7\lambda$ where $\lambda \in \mathbb{N}$ is a fixed constant.

![Triangle with ratio angles](/img/learn/trig-14.svg)

 1. Find the value of $\lambda$.

 1. Given that the perimeter of the triangle is $72\text{cm}$, find the length of $x$, giving your answer in the form
 $$
 a(\sqrt{b} - 1) \quad \left( a,b \in \mathbb{N} \right)
 $$

The angles in a triangle sum to $180^{\circ}$

Let the shortest side be $y$ and the longest side $z$.

Use the sine rule to express $y$ and $z$ in terms of $x$.

The perimeter is $x + y + z$.
