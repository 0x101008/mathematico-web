We saw in the previous tutorial that
$$
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$
is true for every value of $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$

We also saw that
$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
$$
for any $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\cos \theta \neq 0.$

Because these equations are true for every $\theta$ in their respective domains, they are called **identities**.

These identities are very useful, because they allow us to switch between $\sin, \, \cos$ and $\tan,$ as we will see in the next example.

 1. Given that $\sin \theta = \frac{2}{5},$ and that $\theta$ is acute, find the values of $\cos \theta$ and $\tan \theta.$

 1. $\varphi$ is an obtuse angle satisfying $\cos^2 \varphi = \frac{3}{8}.$

    Find the value of $\tan \varphi.$

# Example

Prove the identities

 1. $$
    6 - 3\sin^2 \theta = 3 + 3\cos^2 \theta
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{1}{1 - \cos \theta} = \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{\sin^2 \theta}
    $$

 1. $$
    \cos^2 \theta + \sin \theta \cos \theta \tan \theta = 1
    $$
