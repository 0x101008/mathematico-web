By factorising, or otherwise, solve the following equations for $0 \leq \theta \leq 360$:

 1. $$
    \tan^2 (\theta) + 3 \tan( \theta) - 10 = 0
    $$

 1. $$
    9 \cos^2 \left( \theta \right) - 6 \cos \left( \theta \right) + 1 = 0
    $$

 1. $$
    4\sin^2(\theta) - 9 \sin(\theta) + 2 = 0
    $$

---

For (a), let $t = \tan(\theta).$ Can you solve
$$
t^2 + 3t - 10 = 0
$$
?

---

For (b), let $c = \cos(\theta)$ and consider
$$
9c^2 - 6c + 1 = 0
$$

---

$$
4s^2 - 9s + 2 = (s-2)(4s-1)
$$

Note that $-1 \leq \sin(\theta) \leq 1$ so $\sin(\theta) = 2$ does not lead to any solutions.
