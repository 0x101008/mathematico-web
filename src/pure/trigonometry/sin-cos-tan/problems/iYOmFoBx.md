Solve the equations, for all $\theta$ in the domain $0^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 360^{\circ}$

 1. $$
    \sin^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{4}
    $$

 1. $$
    3\sin^2(\theta) - \sqrt{3}\sin(\theta) = 0
    $$

For (a), square root both sides - but don't forget the negative square root

---

For (b), you cannot divide by $\sin(\theta)$ because it might be $0.$ Instead, factor out $\sin(\theta)$.
