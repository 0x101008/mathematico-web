Use the diagram to explain why
$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
$$

Hence, solve the following for all values of $\theta$ such that $-180 \leq \theta \leq 180.$

 1. $$
    3\sin(\theta) = 2\cos(\theta)
    $$

 1. $$
    \sqrt{5} \sin(\theta) + 2\cos(\theta) = 0
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\cos(\theta)} = 0
    $$

In (a) and (b), you can divide by $\cos(\theta)$, and then make use of the fact that
$$
\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \tan(\theta)
$$

---

In (c), you can multiply by $\sin(\theta)$ to make $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$
