Use the picture below to explain why
$$
\sin^2 (\theta) + \cos^2 (\theta) = 1
$$

Hence, solve the equations
 
 1. $$
    3 \sin^2( \theta ) + \cos^2( \theta ) = 2
    $$

 1. $$
    2 \cos^2(\theta) - 3 \sin^2(\theta) = 1
    $$

giving all solutions $\theta$ satisfying $0 \leq \theta \leq 360.$

By definition,
$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{y}{1} = y
$$
so $y = \sin(\theta).$ Do similar for $\cos(\theta)$ and then use Pythagoras.

Since $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1,$ we can say that $\cos^2(\theta) = 1 - \sin^2(\theta).$

So substitute $\cos^2(\theta) = 1 - \sin^2(\theta)$ into the equation, and now you only have $\sin$ in your equation, which will allow you to solve it!
