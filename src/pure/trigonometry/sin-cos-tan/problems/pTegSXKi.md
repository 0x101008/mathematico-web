Use the triangle below to find the values of

$$
\sin(60), \, \cos(60) \, \text{and} \, \tan(60)
$$

and also

$$
\sin(30), \, \cos(30) \, \text{and} \, \tan(30)
$$

The angles in a equilateral triangle are all $60^{\circ}.$

Draw the height of the triangle from the centre of the base to the top.

The height bisects the base and also bisects the angle at the top.

You can then find the height using Pythagoras.
