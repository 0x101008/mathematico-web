Sometimes, we need to solve an equation like this:
$$
\sin(x + 30) = \frac{3}{4}, \quad 0^{\circ} \leq x \leq 360^{\circ}
$$
This is a transformed equation and it is a very common type of problem. There is a very common mistake which I find students make which I want to make you aware of so you can solve these equations confidently every time. Let's see some examples!

Solve the equations:

 1. $$
    \sin(x + 30) = \frac{3}{4}, \quad 0^{\circ} \leq x \leq 360^{\circ}
    $$

 1. $$
    \cos(5x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi
    $$

 1. $$
    \tan\left( 2\theta - \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = 3, \quad -\pi \leq \theta \leq \pi
    $$
