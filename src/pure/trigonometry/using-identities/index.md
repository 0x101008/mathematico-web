We have already seen how to solve equations such as
$$
\sin(x) = 0.3, \quad -360^{\circ} \leq x \leq 360^{\circ}
$$
(if you're not sure, head back to <nuxt-link to="/skills/pure/trigonometry/sin-cos-tan">these examples</nuxt-link>).

Sometimes, however, there are several steps required before we are ready to solve an equation, as you will see in the next example.

Solve the equation
$$
2 \cos x = -3 \tan x, \quad -360 \leq x \leq 360
$$
