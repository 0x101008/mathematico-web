 1. It is claimed that
    $$
    \sin \psi, \, \cos \psi, \, 2\cos \psi - \sin \psi
    $$
    forms a geometric sequence. Prove that, if this is true, the sequence is constant, stating the constant value of the sequence.

 1. $\varphi$ is chosen such that
    $$
    \sin \varphi, \, \cos \varphi, \, \tan \varphi
    $$
    forms an arithmetic sequence. Show that
    $$
    \tan \varphi = \frac{2\cos \varphi}{1 + \cos \varphi}
    $$
