*Tri* means *three*, *gon* means *knee*, and *ometry* means *the study of*. So, trigonometry is the study of things with three knees... triangles!

We are first introduced to trigonometry by studying right-angled triangles like the one below:

The **trigonometric functions** are defined as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin \theta & = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \\
\cos \theta & = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \\
\tan \theta & = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Before we go on, it is a good idea to be sure we can use these functions confidently.
