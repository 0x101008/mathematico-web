Consider the triangle below, in which the angle is measured in radians.

![Triangle with two sides and included angle](/img/learn/trig-24.svg)

 1. Find the exact length of the side $x$.

 1. Hence, find the other two angles in the triangle, giving your answers to $3 \text{ s.f.}$.

---

Use the cosine rule. Make sure your calculator is in radians mode.

---

To find the other sides, use the sine rule.

Recall that, in radians, the angles in a triangle sum to $\pi$.
