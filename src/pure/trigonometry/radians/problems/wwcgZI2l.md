Solve the equations, finding all $-2\pi \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$,

 1. $$
    \tan^2 \theta - 1 = 0
    $$

 1. $$
    \sqrt{3} \tan \theta = 2 \cos \theta
    $$

---

Rearranging (a) and taking square roots gets the two possible cases
$$
\tan \theta = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad \tan \theta = -1
$$
Sketch $y = \tan \theta$ (in radians) and use the graph to find all solutions.

---

For (b), recall that
$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}
$$
Multiply both sides by $\cos\theta$.

---

Use $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$ to express $\cos^2 \theta$ in terms of $\sin\theta$ - you end up with a quadratic to solve.
