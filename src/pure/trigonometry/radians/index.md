What is so special about the number $360$ anyway? Why not $100$ degrees in a circle?

It could be because the ancient Sumerians preferred to count in groups of $60$. It could be because the ancient Mayans realised that one year is approximately $360$ days, so the Earth moves $1^{\circ}$ around the Sun each day.

In our modern civilisation, we are less concerned with counting and astrology, and more concerned with having convenient mathematical formulas. Therefore, instead of *degrees* we use *radians.* As we will see in the next example, there are exactly $2 \pi$ radians in a whole circle, and everything else follows from there.

 1. 
     - Convert $100^{\circ}$ into radians.

     - Convert $-1.5 \, \text{rad}$ into degrees.

     - Convert $\frac{7\pi}{12} \, \text{rad}$ into degrees.
