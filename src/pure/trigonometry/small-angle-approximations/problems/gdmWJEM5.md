A student attempts to use the small angle to simplify the function
$$
f(\theta) = \sin(\cos(\theta))
$$

Here is their working:

 > Suppose $\theta$ is close to $0$. By the small angle approximation,
 > $$
 > \begin{aligned}
 > f(\theta)
 > & = \sin(\cos(\theta)) \\
 > & \approx \sin\left( 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2} \right) \\
 > & \approx 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}
 > \end{aligned}
 > $$

Explain why the student's reasoning is invalid.

When $\theta$ is small, what can we say about
$$
1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}
$$
?
