Using the small angle approximations for sine and cosine, show that
$$
\sin \left( \frac{5\pi + 2}{20} \right) \approx \frac{219\sqrt{2}}{400}
$$

---

Notice that
$$
\frac{5\pi + 2}{20} = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{10}
$$

---

Recall that
$$
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \sin B \cos A
$$

You know the values of $\sin \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\cos \frac{\pi}{4}$

Since $\frac{1}{10}$ is small, you can use the small angle approximation.
