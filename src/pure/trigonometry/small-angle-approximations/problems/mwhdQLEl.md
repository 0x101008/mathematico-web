The function $f(x)$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = \cos x + \sqrt{3} \sin x
$$
where $x$ is measured in radians.

 1. Express $f(x)$ in the form
    $$
    R \cos(x - \alpha)
    $$
    where $R > 0$ and $\alpha$ is an acute angle measured in radians.

 1. Hence, show that
    $$
    2 - f \left( \frac{3\pi}{8} \right) \approx \frac{\pi^2}{576}
    $$

Part (a) requires you to put $f(x)$ in [harmonic form](/skill/trigonometry/harmonic-form)

---

For part (b), $\frac{3\pi}{8}$ cannot be considered small, so we can't use the small angle approximation directly. Try using the harmonic form of $f(x)$ that you got in part (b).
