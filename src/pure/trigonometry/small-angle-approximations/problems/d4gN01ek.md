The image below suggests that there is a small, positive value of $x$ such that
$$
\sin(2x) = \sqrt{x}
$$

 1. Use the small angle approximation to estimate the coordinates of $P$.

 1. In the image below, $y = \sqrt{x}$ has been translated to the right by $k$ units, and $y = \sin(2x)$ remains unchanged. ![Graph with intersection](/img/learn/trig-41.svg) The image suggests that there should be some value of $k$ such that the curves intersect at exactly one small value of $x.$ Approximate the value of $k.$

For part (a), because $2x$ is small, you can have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(2x) & = \sqrt{x} \\
2x & \approx \sqrt{x}
\end{aligned}
$$
You can square both sides of the equation before rearranging and solving.

For part (b), the translated curve has equation $\sqrt{x - k}.$

---

Square both sides and use the discriminant.
