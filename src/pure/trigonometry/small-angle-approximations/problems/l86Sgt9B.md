 1. Show that, when $\theta$ is small, the value of $\sqrt{2} \sec \theta$ may be approximated by a function of the form
    $$
    f(\theta) = \frac{A}{\theta + \sqrt{2}} + \frac{B}{\theta - \sqrt{2}}
    $$
    where $A$ and $B$ are integers to be determined.

 1. Show that $f(\theta)$ is an even function.

For (a), use the difference of two squares to get
$$
\theta^2 - 2 = (\theta - \sqrt{2})(\theta + \sqrt{2})
$$
