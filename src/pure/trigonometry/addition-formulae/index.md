We would like to know how to calculate something like
$$
\sin \left( A + B \right) \quad \text{ and } \quad \cos \left( A + B \right)
$$
or, indeed, $\tan \left( A + B \right).$

The correct formulas are fairly simple:
$$
\sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B 
$$
and
$$
\cos(A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \mp \sin A \sin B
$$
The formula for $\tan$ can be worked out from these two, and you'll be asked to do that (with hints!) in one of the problems.

The angles $x$ and $y$ are such that $\sin(x) = \frac{2}{5}$ and $\cos(y) = \frac{1}{4}.$

Given that $x$ is obtuse and $y$ is acute, find the exact value of

$$
\cos(x + y) \text{ and } \sin(y - x)
$$
