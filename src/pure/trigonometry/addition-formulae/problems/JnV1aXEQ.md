 1. Solve the equation

    $$
    \arctan(\alpha) + \arctan(3) = \frac{\pi}{4}
    $$

 1. Express
    $$
    \arctan(2) - \arctan\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
    $$
    as a single $\arctan.$

 1. Find a general expression for
    $$
    \arctan(\alpha) + \arctan(\beta)
    $$
    as a single $\arctan.$

Start by taking $\tan$ of both sides of the equation. Recall that, since $\tan$ and $\arctan$ are inverse functions, we have
$$
\tan(\arctan(x)) = x
$$
for any $x.$

Let $y = \arctan(2) - \arctan\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$ and then take $\tan$ of both sides.
