Use the formula
$$
\tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan A \pm \tan B}{1 \mp \tan A \tan B}
$$
to find the values of:

 1. $$
    \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \right)
    $$

 1. $$
    \tan \left( \frac{5\pi}{12} \right)
    $$

 1. $$
    \tan \left( 165^{\circ} \right)
    $$

---

For (a),
$$
\frac{\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{4}
$$

---

For (b),
$$
\frac{5\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{6}
$$
or you could do
$$
\frac{5\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{\pi}{12}
$$
and make use of the answer to part (a).

---

For (c), notice that
$$
165 = 180 - 15
$$
In part (a), we found $\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right),$ and $\frac{\pi}{12}$ rad is $15^{\circ}.$
