Functions of the form $\frac{1}{\sin x}$ occur so frequently that we give them their own names:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\cos x} & = \sec x \\[1em]
\frac{1}{\sin x} & = \cosec x \\[1em]
\frac{1}{\tan x} & = \cot x
\end{aligned}
$$
Starting with the identity $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, we can show that
$$
\tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x
$$
and
$$
1 + \cot^2 x = \cosec^2 x
$$

 1. Sketch the curve
    $$
    y = \cosec x, \quad -2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi
    $$

 1. Show that
    $$
    1 + \cot^2 x = \cosec^2 x
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    4 \cot^2 \theta + 7 = 8 \cosec \theta
    $$
    giving all $\theta$ satisfying $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$
