 1. Sketch the curve
    $$
    y = \sec(2x), \quad 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi
    $$

 1. Solve the equation
    $$
    2 \cos(x) \sec(2x) = - 1, \quad -2 \pi \leq x \leq 2 \pi
    $$

---

To sketch $y = \sec(2x)$, first sketch $\cos(x)$, use that to sketch $\sec(x)$, then apply a scale factor enlargement in the $x$ direction.

---

To solve the equation, rewrite it as
$$
\frac{2 \cos(x)}{cos(2x)} = -1
$$
and apply a double angle formula to $\cos(2x)$.
