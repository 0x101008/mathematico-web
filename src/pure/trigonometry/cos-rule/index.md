The cosine rule allows us to find missing sides or missing angles in any type of triangle.

The cosine rule states that
$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
$$
The cosine rule starts like Pythagoras with $a^2 = b^2 + c^2,$ but because this isn't generally a right-angled triangle we have the extra term $-2bc\cos A$.

This would work with any of the sides at the front of the formula, so
$$
\begin{aligned}
b^2 & = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos B \\
c^2 & = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C
\end{aligned}
$$
also work.

One of the problems will invite you to try and prove the cosine rule, but for now let's get used to using it.

 1. A triangle has sides of length $3$ and $4,$ and the angle between these sides is $120^{\circ}.$ Find the length of the third side. ![Triangle with missing side](/img/learn/trig-03.svg)  <!-- <v-video id="482415955"></v-video> -->

 1. A triangle has sides of length $7$ and $k,$ and the angle between them is $110^\circ.$ Given that the third side of the triangle has length $12,$ find the value of $k.$ ![Triangle with side k](/img/learn/trig-04.svg) <!-- <v-video id="482415931"></v-video> -->
