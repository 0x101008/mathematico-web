Use Pythagoras to find a relationship between $c, \, h$ and $x.$

Do similar to find a relationship between $a, \, h$ and $(b-x).$

---

In the previous hint, we found two equations using Pythagoras. Eliminate $h$ from these equations (either by substituting $h^2$ from one equation into the other, or by subtracting the equations).

---

Notice that $\cos A = \frac{x}{c}.$ Use this to eliminate $x$ from the equation found in the previous hint.
