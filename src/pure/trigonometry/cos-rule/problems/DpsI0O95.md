$A, B$ are adjacent vertices of a cube. $C$ lies on the edge diagonally opposite to $AB$ and divides that edge in the ratio $2:1.$

The angle $\angle ACB$ is labelled $\theta.$ Find $\theta.$

Let the edge on which $C$ lies be called $DE.$

It is convenient to let $AB = 3x$ so that $DC = 2x$ and $CE = x.$

---

Use Pythagoras to find the diagonal $BE$ in terms of $x$ (and note that this is the same as $AD.$)

$\triangle BCE$ is a right-angled triangle so Pythagoras applies once again!
