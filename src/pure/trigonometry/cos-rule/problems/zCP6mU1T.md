The cyclic quadrilateral $PQRS$ is such that the angle at $P$ is $70^\circ,$ the length $QR$ is $4$ and the length $RS$ is $5.$

Find the area of the circumscribed circle.

Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to $180^\circ$ (that is to say, the sum of the angles at $R$ and $P$ is $180^\circ$)

Use the previous hint with the cosine rule on $\triangle QRS$ to find $QS.$
