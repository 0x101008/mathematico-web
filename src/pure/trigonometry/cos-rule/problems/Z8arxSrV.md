A triangle $ABC$ is drawn with angle $A = 46^{\circ}.$

The side $AC$ has length $\sqrt{85}$ and the side $BC$ has length $2 \sqrt{13}.$

 1. Find, to three significant figures, the two possible lengths of side $c.$

 1. Sketch the triangle in each case.

You should use the cosine rule in the form
$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
$$

When you use the cosine rule, you should end up with a quadratic in terms of $c$.

You will need the quadratic formula (or completing the square).
