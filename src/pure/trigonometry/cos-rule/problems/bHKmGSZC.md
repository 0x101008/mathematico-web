The triangle $ABC$ is such that $AB$ has length $x,$ $BC$ has length $x - 1$ and $CA$ has length $2$.

Given that the angle at $B$ is $30^\circ,$ find the value of $x,$ giving your answer to three significant figures.

You should end up with a quadratic in terms of $x.$ It might look a bit scary, but use the quadratic formula carefully and it will work out.
