A triangle has sides of length $x - 1, \, x, \, x + 1.$ The largest angle in the triangle is $135^\circ.$

Find the value of $x,$ giving your answer in the form $p\sqrt{q} + r,$ where $p, q, r \in \mathbb{Z}.$

Although you end up with a quadratic, you don't need the formula because there is no constant term. Just factor out the $x$ and find the roots.

To get your answer in the form required, you need to rationalise the denominator.
