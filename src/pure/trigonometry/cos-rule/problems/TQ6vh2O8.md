The parabola
$$
y = x^2 - 4x + 6
$$
and the line
$$
y = 2x + 1
$$
intersect at $P$ and $R.$

Find the angle $\angle PQR,$ where $Q$ is the vertex of the parabola.

---

Find the coordinates of $P$ and $R$ by solving $x^2 - 4x + 6 = 2x + 1.$

---

Complete the square on $y = x^2 - 4x + 6$ to find the vertex.

The formula for the distance between two points can find $PR, \, RQ$ and $QP.$ Then the cosine rule applies.
