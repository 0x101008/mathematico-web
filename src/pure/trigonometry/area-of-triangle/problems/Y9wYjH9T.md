A triangle has sides of length $3, 4$ and $6.$

Prove that the area of the triangle is exactly $\frac{\sqrt{455}}{4}$

---

Use the cosine rule to get the value of $\cos\theta$. Don't round it - leave it as an exact value and then use
$$
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
$$
to find the exact value of $\sin \theta$.

---

Now you know $\sin \theta$ you can use the area formula.
