The angles in the below triangle are all acute:

![Triangle with two sides and one angle](/img/learn/trig-20.svg)

Given that $\sin\alpha$ is equal to $\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}$, find the exact value of the area of the triangle.

---

Use the fact that
$$
\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1
$$
to find $\cos \alpha$.

---

Use the cosine rule to find the missing side, and then the area formula to find the area of the triangle.
