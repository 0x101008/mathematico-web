In the diagram below, a triangle is drawn within a rectangle:

![Rectangle with triangle](/img/learn/trig-18.svg)

By considering the area of the rectangle, prove that

 1. $$
    ad - bc = pq \sin \theta
    $$

 1. Hence, by considering $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$, prove that
    $$
    ac + bd = pq \cos \theta
    $$

It is clear that the area of the rectangle is equal to $ad.$

However, we can also compute the area by summing the four triangles:

Equating these should lead to part (a).

For part (b), rearrange part (a) to make $\sin \theta$ the subject and square both sides.

Now use the fact that $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$ to replace $\sin^2 \theta$ with $1 - \cos^2 \theta.$

There is quite a bit of algebra to do, but stick with it: it does work out in the end.

(At some point, you will need to use $p^2 = a^2 + b^2$ and $q^2 = c^2 + d^2.$)

$$
a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + 2abcd = (ac)^2 + (bd)^2 + 2(ac)(bd)
$$
