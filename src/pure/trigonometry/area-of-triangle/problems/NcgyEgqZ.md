The six vertices of a regular hexagon lie upon the circumference of the circle
$$
x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y - 37 = 0
$$
Find the area of the hexagon.

---

Complete the square on $x^2 - 6x$ and on $y^2 + 4y$ to get the equation of the circle in the form
$$
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2
$$
You need $r$ ($a$ and $b$ are irrelevant).

The angle $\theta$ should be easy to find, since the hexagon is formed by $6$ identical triangles.
