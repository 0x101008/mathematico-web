With the sine rule and the cosine rule, we have some very useful formulas for dealing with triangles of all shapes and sizes. There is one more: the area of a triangle.

<geogebra id="uftgzbxs"></geogebra>

Given two sides $a$ and $b,$ and the angle $\theta$ between then, the area of the triangle is
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} a b \sin \theta
$$
You'll get the chance to prove this formula as one of the problems.
