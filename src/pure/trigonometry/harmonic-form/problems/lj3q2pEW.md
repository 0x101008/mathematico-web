 1. Express
    $$
    f(x) = \sin(x) - \sqrt{3} \cos(x)
    $$
    in the form
    $$
    A \sin (x - k \pi)
    $$
    where $k \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $0 < k < 1.$

 1. Sketch the curve $y = f(x).$

 1. Find the maximum value of $f(x)$ and the smallest positive value of $x$ for which this occurs.
