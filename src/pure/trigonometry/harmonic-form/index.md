If we plot the curve
$$
y = 2 \sin(x) + \cos(x)
$$
it looks like so:

This looks suspiciously like a transformed $\sin$ curve! It's just been translated and enlarged. So, maybe we should hope that there exist some $R$ and $\alpha$ such that
$$
2 \sin(x) + \cos(x) = R \sin(x + \alpha)
$$
The $R$ here is what provides the stretch, and the $\alpha$ provides the translation.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to find $R$ and $\alpha$ so that we can simplify expressions like $2 \sin(x) + \cos(x)$ into a single trig function.

 1. Express
    $$
    2 \sin(x) + \cos(x)
    $$
    in the form
    $$
    R \sin(x + \alpha)
    $$
    where $R > 0$ and $0 < \alpha < \pi.$

 1. Express
    $$
    2\sqrt{2} \cos(x) - 4\sqrt{2} \sin(x)
    $$
    in the form
    $$
    R \cos(x + \alpha)
    $$
    where $R > 0$ and $0 < \alpha < \pi.$

 1. Hence, solve the equation
    $$
    \sqrt{30} \cos x - \sqrt{15} \sin x = \sqrt{5}, \quad 0 < x < 2\pi
    $$
