One reason why radians are so convenient is that they allow us to calculate arc lengths and areas much more easily.

<geogebra id="subvu7pp"></geogebra>

The circumference and area of the whole circle are $2 \pi r$ and $\pi r^2,$ so in degrees, we have
$$
\ell = 2 \pi r \times \frac{\theta \text{ in degrees}}{360}
$$
and
$$
A = \pi r^2 \times \frac{\theta \text{ in degrees}}{360}
$$
However, in radians, this simplifies to
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & = 2 \pi r \times \frac{\theta \text{ in radians}}{2\pi} \\
& = r \theta
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & = \pi r^2 \times \frac{\theta \text{ in radians}}{2\pi} \\
& = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \theta
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus, we get two neat formulas:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & = r \theta\\
A & = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\end{aligned}
$$
