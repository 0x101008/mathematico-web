There are three prime numbers $a,b,c$ such that $abc = 5159$. Can you find them? With a little time, yes, you probably could, but it is a lot easier if I tell you that $a = 67$. Then $5159 \div 67 = 77$ and finding $b$ and $c$ is easy.

The situation with cubics is much the same. If I told you that there are three brackets such that
$$
(x - \alpha)(x - \beta)(x - \gamma) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6
$$
could you find those brackets? It's hard, but if I told you that one of those brackets (one of the *factors*) is $(x + 3)$ it becomes much easier.

On the next page, we'll see exactly how to do this.

 1. Given that $(x + 3)$ is a factor of the cubic
    $$
    p(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6
    $$
    write the cubic as a product of three linear factors.

 1. Given that $(x + 4)$ is a factor of the cubic
    $$
    f(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + 6x - 56
    $$
    factorise the cubic completely.

 1. Given that $(x+1)$ is a factor of the cubic
    $$
    g(x) = x^3 - 43x - 42
    $$
    solve the equation
    $$
    g(x) = 0
    $$
