Given that $(x - 2)$ is a factor of
$$
x^3 - 8
$$
use long division to completely factorise the expression.

Hence, prove that $2$ is the only real cube root of $8.$

---

When doing the long division, you'll need to use
$$
x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 8
$$

---

If $x^3 = 8$ then $x^3 - 8 = 0.$ Express this equation in factorised form and use the discriminant to argue that there's only one real solution.
