A cuboid has a volume given by
$$
V(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + 23x + 15
$$
The height of the cuboid is $x + 5.$

![Cuboid of height x+5](/img/learn/poly-01.svg)

Find an expression, in terms of $x,$ for the area of the base of the cuboid.

---

If $A$ is the area of the base, then
$$
V = A(x+5)
$$
Rearrange to make $A$ the subject and use long division.
