Let $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ Given that $(x-n)$ is a factor, use long division to factorise the expression
$$
x^3 - n^3
$$

Hence, prove that $n$ is the only real cube root of $n^3.$

Use long division to divide $x - n$ into
$$
x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - n^3
$$
and use the discriminant, similar to the previous problem.
