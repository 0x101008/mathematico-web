# Introduction

When dealing with integers, we say that $7$ is a *factor* of $56$ because
$$
56 = 7 \times 8
$$
and so $56$ can be divided by $7$ with no remainder.

The relationship with $10$ and $56$ is different. The closest we can get without exceeding $56$ is $10 \times 5 = 50,$ and we have a remainder of $6,$
$$
56 = 10 \times 5 + 6
$$
In this case, $6$ is the *remainder* and $5$ is called the *quotient*.

With polynomials, it is similar: $(x-4)$ is not a factor of $x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 11x - 12,$ but we can write
$$
x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 11x - 12 = (x - 4)(x^2 + 6x + 13) + 40
$$
In this case, the $40$ is the *remainder* and $x^2 + 6x + 13$ is the quotient.

Over the page, we will learn how to find the quotient and remainder using long division.

 1. The polynomial
    $$
    x^4 + 2x^3 - 3x - 1
    $$
    can be written in the form
    $$
    (x + 3)q(x) + r
    $$
    where $q(x)$ is a polynomial and $r$ is a constant.

    Find $q(x)$ and $r.$

 1. Use the factor theorem to show that $(x + 3)$ is a factor of $x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$
 
 1. Use the remainder theorem to find the remainder when $x^4 - 2x^2 + x + 1$ is divided by $(x + 1)$

 1. The remainder when
    $$
    p(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 - bx - 4
    $$
    is divided by $(x + 3)$ is equal to $-25$. Given also that $(x - 2)$ is a factor of $p,$ find the values of $a$ and $b.$
