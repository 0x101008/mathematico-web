The method of partial fractions allows us to separate a fraction into two, simpler fractions like this:
$$
\frac{3x + 1}{x^2 + 2x - 3} = \frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{1}{x-1}
$$
Going from right-to-left is just adding together two fractions and is easier; going from left-to-right is trickier, and that's what partial fractions is all about.

Use the method of partial fractions to decompose the following fractions:

 1. $$
    \frac{17}{3x^2 + 13x - 10}
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{4x^2 + 5x - 21}{(x+2)(x-3)(x-1)}
    $$

 1. $$
    \frac{2x^2 + 8x + 10}{(x+1)(x+2)^2}
    $$
