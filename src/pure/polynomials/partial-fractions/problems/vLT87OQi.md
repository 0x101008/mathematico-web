The function $f$ is defined by
$$
f(x) = \frac{kx}{(x+k)^2}, \quad x \neq -k
$$
Find, in terms of $k,$ expressions for $A$ and $B$ such that
$$
f(x) = \frac{A}{x+k} + \frac{B}{(x+k)^2}
$$

This is a bit like Exercise 3 where you have a repeated root. You will need to let $x = -k$ to find $B$ and then compare the coefficient of $x$ to find $A.$ Just treat $k$ as if it were any fixed number.
