The volume of a triangular-based pyramid is known to be $8.$

<!-- <img-caption src="/img/books/pure/polynomials/partial-fractions-1.png" height="30vh"></img-caption> -->

The area of the base of the pyramid is given by
$$
x^2 + 12x + 32
$$
Find an expression for the height of the pyramid, giving your answer in the form
$$
\frac{A}{p(x)} + \frac{B}{q(x)}
$$
where $A, B$ are integers and $p, q$ are linear functions.

The volume of a pyramid is given by
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{ Area of base } \times \text{ Height }
$$
