The cubic function $p$ is defined by
$$
p(x) = x(x+1)(x+2) + (x+1)(x+2)(x+3)
$$

Solve the equation
$$
p(x) = 0
$$
and hence sketch the curve
$$
y = p(x)
$$

Don't expand the brackets: focus on factorising out the common factors.

$$
x \underbrace{(x+1)(x+2)} + \underbrace{(x+1)(x+2)}(x+3) = (x+1)(x+2)\left[ x + (x + 3) \right]
$$
