The cubic
$$
y = (x + 1)(x^2 + 3x - 17)
$$
intersects with the line
$$
y = x + 1
$$
at three distinct points. Find the coordinates of these three points.

To find the $x$ coordinates of the points of intersection, you would need to solve
$$
(x + 1)(x^2 + 3x - 17) = x + 1
$$
Again, don't expand the brackets: you can remove a common factor of $x+1.$

You can use a similar idea to what we used in the previous problem:
$$
\underbrace{ (x+1) }(x^2 + 3x - 17) - \underbrace{ (x+1) }
$$
