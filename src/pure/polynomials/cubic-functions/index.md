A cubic curve is given by an equation of the form

$$
y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, \quad a \neq 0
$$

It looks a bit like a quadratic, but there is a new term in $x^3.$ This new term
will change the shape of the graph we get, as you will see in the next examples.

Three cubics are defined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & = (x - 3)(x - 2)(x + 1) \\
g(x) & = (x + 4)(x^2 + x - 2) \\
h(x) & = (2 - x)(x^2 + 10x + 25)
\end{aligned}
$$

Sketch the graphs of these functions, indicating the intersections with the
axes. You do not need to calculate the turning points.

<hint>

Use the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac,$ on $x^2 + 2x + 2$

# Problem

A sphere and a cone are constructed, where the radius of the sphere is equal to
the radius of the circular base of the cone. The height of the cone is two units
larger than the radius of its base.

Given that the sphere and the cone have the same volume, find the value of the
radius shared by the sphere and the cone.

<hint>

The volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is

$$
\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

and the volume of a cone of height $h$ and radius $r$ is

$$
\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
$$

# Problem

You are given that any cubic must have at least one real root (the proof of this
is quite hard, we assume it for now).

Given any quadratic and any cubic, prove that they must eventually intersect.

<img src="/img/books/pure/polynomials/cubic-8.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-height: 35vh; max-width: 100%;">

<hint>

Let the quadratic curve be

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

and the cubic curve be

$$
y = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s
$$

How would you find the points of intersection?

</hint>

<hint>

How will you use the information that _every_ cubic has at least one root?
