In the picture below, the point $A$ is always a distance of $3$ away from the fixed point $C(1,2)$. Try moving $A$ around to see what happens.

The shape is a circle. If the coordinates of $A$ are $(x,y)$, then, by the distance formula, we must have
$$
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2} = 3
$$
More generally, if a circle has centre $(a,b)$ and radius $r$, then $(x,y)$ lies on the circle if, and only if,
$$
\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} = r
$$
It is customary to square both sides, giving the **equation of a circle**:
$$
(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2
$$

 1. Write down the equation of a circle with radius $3\sqrt{3}$ and centre $(6, -3).$ Sketch this circle, indicating all intersections with the coordinate axes.

 1. A circle has equation
    $$
    x^2 + y^2 - 14x + 8y = 60
    $$
    Work out the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius of the circle.
