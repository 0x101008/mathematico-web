The circle sketched below is centered at the point $(6,3)$ and touches the $y$-axis only at $G$.

![Circle centered at (6,3)](/img/learn/geom-14.svg)

Write down the coordinates of $G,$ and calculate the coordinates of $E$ and $F.$

---

You can find the radius by looking at the $x$ coordinate of the centre - how far is it from $G$? This should enable you to find the equation of the circle.

---

Once you have the equation of the circle, notice that $y = 0$ at the points $E$ and $F.$
