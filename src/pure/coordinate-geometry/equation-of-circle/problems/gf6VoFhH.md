The points $A(-8, p)$ and $B(q, 6)$ lie on the circle with equation
$$
(x + 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 20
$$

 1. Given that $p > 0$ and $p + q > 0,$ find the values of $p$ and $q.$

 1. Find the shortest distance from the centre of the circle to the chord $AB.$

Substitute the coordinates of $A$ into the equation of the circle and solve to find $p.$ Similar for $q.$

Once you have $p$ and $q$, you can draw a diagram to help with (b).

Here is the diagram, with a couple of clues:
