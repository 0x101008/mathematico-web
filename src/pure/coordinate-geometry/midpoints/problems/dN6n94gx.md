The point $A$ is the vertex of the parabola
$$
y = x^2 - 2x + 2
$$
The point $B$ lies on the parabola to the right of $A.$ The point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB.$

A triangle $PQR$ is formed, where

 - $P,Q$ are the points of intersection between the parabola and the horizontal line through $M$

 - $R$ lies on the parabola directly below $M.$

Given that the area of the triangle $PQR$ is $\sqrt{2},$ find the coordinates of $B.$

Your diagram should look like this:

$A$ has coordinates $(1,1).$ If we let $B$ have $x$-coordinate $b,$ then we have $B = (b, b^2 - 2b + 2).$

---

The coordinates of $M$ are
$$
\left( \frac{b+1}{2}, \frac{b^2 - 2b + 3}{2} \right)
$$
$R$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $M$

$P,Q$ have the same $y$-coordinate as $M.$

---

After finding $R$ in terms of $b$, you should find that the height of the triangle is
$$
\left( \frac{b-1}{2} \right)^2
$$

---

After finding $P$ and $Q$ in terms of $b$, you should find that the base of the triangle is
$$
\sqrt{2}\,(b-1)
$$
