## Parallel lines

When two lines are **parallel**, they have the **same gradient**. So, in the below picture

![Parallel lines](/img/learn/geom-11.svg)

we have
$$
m_1 = m_2
$$

## Perpendicular lines

When lines are **perpendicular**, they **meet at a right-angle**.

As we will see in a later problem, perpendicular gradients have the special property that
$$
m_1 \times m_2 = -1
$$
which is sometimes written as
$$
m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}
$$
(We sometimes say that $m_2$ is the *negative reciprocal* of $m_1$.)
