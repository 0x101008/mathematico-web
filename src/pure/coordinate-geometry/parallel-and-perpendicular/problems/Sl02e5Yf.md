The lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ have equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
ax + 2y + 4 & = 0 \\[5pt]
5x - by & = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

You are given that $\ell_1$ passes through $(1,-1)$ and that $\ell_1$ is parallel to $\ell_2.$

Find the values of $a$ and $b.$

---

The point $(1,-1)$ lies on $\ell_1$, so it satisfies its equation.

To find the gradient of a line, put its equation in the form
$$
y = mx + c
$$
