The points $A$ and $B$ have coordinates $(1, -5)$ and $(3, 5).$

The perpendicular bisector of $A$ and $B$ intersects the axes at $P$ and $Q.$

Find the area of the triangle formed by the origin and the points $P$ and $Q.$

Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector, then calculate where it intersect the axes. Draw a diagram!
