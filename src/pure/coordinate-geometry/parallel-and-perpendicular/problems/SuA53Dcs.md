Prove, by contradiction, that three distinct lines in the plane cannot be perpendicular to one another.

---

One way to do this would be to let the lines be
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = px + a \\[5pt]
y & = qx + b \\[5pt]
y & = rx + c
\end{aligned}
$$
Suppose they are perpendicular to each other and consider the relationship between $p, q$ and $r.$

---

If the lines are perpendicular, then
$$
\begin{aligned}
pq & = -1 \\[5pt]
qr & = -1 \\[5pt]
rp & = -1
\end{aligned}
$$
What is wrong with this? (Try multiplying the first two equations!)
