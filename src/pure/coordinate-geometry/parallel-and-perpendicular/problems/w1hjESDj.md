The lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ have equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell_1: & & 2x + y = 10 \\[5pt]
\ell_2: & & 2y - x = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

 1. Verify that $(4,2)$ lies on both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2.$

 1. Prove that the lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are perpendicular.

 1. Find the area of the triangle formed by $\ell_1, \ell_2$ and the $y$-axis.

---

For (a), just substitute the point into both lines and make sure the equation is satisfied.

---

For (b), put each line into the form $y = mx + c$ and demonstrate that $m_1m_2 = -1$

---

Draw a picture. You can use a horizontal and vertical line to find the area, which is easier than calculating lengths of the diagonal lines.
