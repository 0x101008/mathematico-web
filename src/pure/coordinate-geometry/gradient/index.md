The *gradient* of a line is a measure of its *steepness*. Have a play with the diagram below: change the steepness and make the gradient change. See if you can make the gradient negative. See if you can make it equal $0.$

The gradient is often denoted by $m,$ and it is calculated by
$$
\begin{aligned}
m
& = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} \\[5pt]
& = \frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A}
\end{aligned}
$$
If we are on the line, and we move to the right by $1$ unit, we move in the $y$ direction by $m$ units:
