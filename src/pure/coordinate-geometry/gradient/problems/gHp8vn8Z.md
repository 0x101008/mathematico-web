Two lines are said to be **parallel** if they have the **same gradient**.

The line segment connecting $A(a, \alpha)$ with $B(4,1)$ is parallel and equal in length to the line segment connecting $C(-1,3)$ with $D(4,15).$

Find the possible coordinates of the point $A.$

What kind of shape is $ABCD$?

---

By considering the gradient of $AB$ and $CD$, you can show that
$$
5(\alpha - 1) = 12(a - 4)
$$

---

By considering the lengths $|AB|$ and $|CD|,$ you can show that
$$
(a-4)^2 + (\alpha - 1)^2 = 13^2
$$

Now use the equation you got from the previous hint to replace $(\alpha - 1)$ in this equation and solve to find $a.$
