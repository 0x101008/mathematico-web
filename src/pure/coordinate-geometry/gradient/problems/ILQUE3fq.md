Let $ABCD$ be any quadrilateral in the $xy$-plane.

Let $P, Q, R, S$ be the midpoints of $AB, BC, CD, DA$ respectively.

This diagram suggests that $PQRS$ is always a parallelogram.

Prove this is the case.

Find $P$ in terms of $A(x_A, y_A)$ and $B(x_B, y_B)$ using the midpoint formula, and do similar for $Q, R, S.$ Show algebraically that
$$
m_{PQ} = m_{RS}
$$
and similar for $QR$ and $SP.$
