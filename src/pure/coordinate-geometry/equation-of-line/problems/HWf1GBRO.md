The line $\ell$ passes through $(9,12)$ and $(11,7)$.

 1. Find an equation for $\ell$, giving your answer in the form
    $$
    ax + by + c = 0
    $$
    for $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$.

 1. Given that $\ell$ crosses the axes at $P$ and $Q$, find the area of the triangle $OPQ$, where $O$ is the origin.

Find the equation of the line. Substitute $x=0$ to find $P$ and $y=0$ to find $Q$. Draw a diagram!
