The straight lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ each pass through the point $(5,4)$. The $y$ intercept of $\ell_1$ is $-1$ and the $x$ intercept of $\ell_2$ is $13$.

The points $A$ and $B$ lie on the line $y = 2$.

Given that $A$ lies on $\ell_1$ and $B$ lies on $\ell_2$, find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

You will need to find the equations of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$.
