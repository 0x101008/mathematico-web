In the image below, moving the points $A$ and $B$ on the line will not change the gradient between them.

This is the key to finding the equation of a straight line. On the next page, we're going to develop and use the **point-slope formula** which gives the equation of a straight line quickly and conveniently.

 1. Find the equation of the straight line with gradient $3$ passing through the point $(2,5)$,
    giving your answer in the form
    $$
    y = mx + c
    $$
    State the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of this line.

 1. Find the equation of the straight line which passes through the points
    $$
    (-2, 3) \quad \text{and} \quad (5, 7)
    $$
    giving your answer in the form
    $$
    ax + by + c = 0
    $$
