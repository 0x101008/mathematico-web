Find the exact distance between the points of intersection of the line
$$
y = 2x - 1
$$
with the parabola
$$
y = 4 - x^2
$$

Solve
$$
4 - x^2 = 2x - 1
$$
to find the coordinates, then use the distance formula.

The questions says *exact* so give your answer in terms of surds, $\sqrt{\text{something}},$ rather than a decimal.
