Two boats, $A$ and $B$, are moving on still, open water. Relative to a lighthouse positioned at the point $(0,0)$, the positions of the boats at time $t$ are given by
$$
A = (2t + 1, t-2)
$$
and
$$
B =  (t-1, 2t)
$$

 1. Find the time at which $A$ is equidistant from the lighthouse and $B$.

 1. Find the distance from $A$ to the lighthouse at this time.

---

The distance from $A$ to the lighthouse can be found using the distance formula on
$$
(0,0) \quad \text{and} \quad (2t + 1, t-2)
$$

---

The distance from $A$ to $B$ can be found using the distance formula on
$$
(t-1, 2t) \quad \text{and} \quad (2t + 1, t-2)
$$

*Equidistant* means the two distances must be equal.
