Let's take two points, $A(x_A, y_A)$ and $B(x_B,y_B)$ in the plane.

<geogebra id="eercautm"></geogebra>

The length of the blue line is given by $x_B - x_A$, and the length of the red line is given by $y_B - y_A$.

Therefore, the distance between the points can be found using Pythagoras' Theorem:
$$
d = \sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}
$$
Let's practise using this formula and applying it to some problems.

 1. Use the distance formula to find the exact value of the distance between:
    $$
    (-1,5) \quad \text{and} \quad (8,-2)
    $$

 1. The distance between the point $(k,3)$ and $(2,5)$ is equal to $7.$

    Find the possible values of $k.$
