We have seen the word **tangent** before when we studied parabolas. We defined it loosely as a line that *just touches* a curve.

A **normal** line is perpendicular to the tangent.

Here is how a tangent and normal to a circle would look. Move the centre $C$ and the point $P$ to get a sense for how the tangent and normal behave.

In this tutorial, we are going to see how to work out the equation of a tangent and the equation of a normal using the point-slope formula:
$$
y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)
$$

 1. The point $P(7, -8)$ lies on the circle with equation
    $$
    (x - 5)^2 + (y + 10)^2 = 8
    $$
    Find the equation of the normal to the circle at $P.$

 1. The point $Q(-5,-1)$ lies on the circle
    $$
    (x - 5)^2 - 1 = (10 - y)(10 + y)
    $$
    Find an equation for the tangent to the circle at the point $Q.$
