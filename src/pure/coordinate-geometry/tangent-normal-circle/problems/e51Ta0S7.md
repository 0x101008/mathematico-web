The line
$$
y = mx + c
$$
is a tangent to the circle with equation
$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$

Let the point of tangency be $P.$

 1. Find, in terms of $m$ and $c,$ the coordinates of $P.$

 1. Hence, prove that the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius joining the origin to $P.$

To find the coordinates of $P,$ substitute the line $y = mx + c$ into the equation of the circle
$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$
You will get a quadratic equation in terms of $x.$ Use the formula.

Remember that, if there is only one intersection, then $b^2 - 4ac = 0$. This makes the equation much simpler.

If you get the coordinates of $P$ correct, then the gradient of the radius $OP$ will become something very simple and familiar.
