The tangent to the circle

$$
(x + 6)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 13
$$

passes through the point $Q(5, 2).$

Given that the tangent touches the circle at the point $P,$ find the distance from $Q$ to $P.$

Do not try to find the coordinates of $P$. You don't need them.

Here's a diagram:

Find $|CP|$ and $|CQ|$, then use Pythagoras. (Notice that $|CP|$ is the radius of the circle, so you can look at the equation of the circle to get that!)
