# AoC 2023: Problem 5

## Part 1

I decided to view each line in the map as a function. We are essentially told
the functions domain (the possible inputs) and range (the possible outputs).

A useful observations is this: each function simply adds a particular number to
its inputs. Let's take an example row from one of the maps:

```txt
y  x  r
60 56 37
```

For any input from `56` to `56 + 37`, this function just adds `60 - 56` to the
input. Symbolically, any input from `x` to `x + r` gets `y - x` added to it.

Now we're ready to take a look at the solution, which is nice and short.

```python
a = float("inf") # infinity
for s in seeds:
    for m in maps:
        for y, x, r in m:
            if x <= s < x + r:
                s += y - x
                break
    a = min(s, a)

print(a)
```

## Part 2

As most others probably did, I optimistically thought this would be quite easy.
Just apply the previous solution to the new, bigger list of seeds. Simple!
Technically, it works; practically, it doesn't. I left it running for a few
minutes, then cancelled to program to think again.

The idea which works is to notice that it isn't necessary to map each individual
seed, we only need to think about mapping _endpoints_. This is enough to tell
you about the whole batch.

### Batches

Let's visualise the batches of seeds lying along a numberline:

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-02.svg)

I decided to make a class to create the batches

```python
class Batch:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
```

### Functions

Then, let's draw around some areas which represent the domains of the functions
in one of the maps:

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-01.svg)

See the area of batch 1 which falls inside the domain of the first function? We
just consider where `f1` would send `batch.start` and `f1.end`. We don't bother
about all the seeds between.

For `f2`, we just consider where it maps `f2.start` and `batch.end`.

For `f3`, it lies entirely inside a batch, so we consider where it sends the
start and end of its domain: `f3.start` and `f3.end`.

Again, I made a class to create the functions

```python
class Func(Batch):
    def __init__(self, start, end, add=0):
        super().__init__(start, end)
        self.add = add
```

The parameter `add` is the fixed amount which the function adds to each seed.

### Identity functions

Parts of batches get transformed by adding a fixed number to each seed. But
other parts of batches get left alone. I felt that dealing with this as an `if`
would be quite annoying.

Leaving something alone is a well known concept in maths called the _identity
function_. If I fill in the gaps between the domains with identity functions,
then every seed gets acted on by a function, and it makes the logic later that
much easier.

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-03.svg)

Creating an identity function with my `Func` class is easy because the default
value for the `add` parameter is `0`, so `Func(start, end)` is a function which
takes seeds from the input range `start` to `end` and... _does nothing to them_!

The code which creates all the identity functions and adds them to the maps
looks like this:

```python
def get_identities(map):
    map = sorted(map, key=lambda f: f.start)

    # cover the beginning and end of the numberline
    from_neg_inf = Func(float("-inf"), map[0].start - 1)
    to_pos_inf = Func(map[-1].end + 1, float("inf"))

    identities = [from_neg_inf, to_pos_inf]

    # fill in the gaps between functions in map
    for i in range(1, len(map) - 1):
        end, start = map[i].end, map[i + 1].start

        if start - end > 1:
            identities.append(Func(start, end))

    return identities
```

### Applying the functions

For any given batch, we must decide which functions from the map overlap with
the batch. For example, here are the three functions which apply to the second
batch:

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-04.svg)

Notice that these three functions satisfy the condition

```python
f1.start < batch.end and f1.end > batch.start
```

We hold the transformed batches in a new array called `mapped`. To find the
start of a transformed batch of seeds, we need to decide whether to add `f.add`
to the start of the function's domain or the batch itself.

```python
start = max(batch.start, f.start) + f.add
end = min(batch.end, f.end) + f.add
mapped.append(Batch(start, end))
```

For `f1` in this image, this would be `batch.start`, whereas for `f3` it would
be `f3.start`:

### The full solution

With all these ideas established, here is the full solution.

```python
import re


class Batch:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end


class Func(Batch):
    def __init__(self, start, end, add=0):
        super().__init__(start, end)
        self.add = add


def get_identities(map):
    map = sorted(map, key=lambda f: f.start)

    from_neg_inf = Func(float("-inf"), map[0].start - 1)
    to_pos_inf = Func(map[-1].end + 1, float("inf"))

    identities = [from_neg_inf, to_pos_inf]

    for i in range(1, len(map) - 1):
        end, start = map[i].end, map[i + 1].start

        if start - end > 1:
            identities.append(Func(start, end))

    return identities


with open("./input.txt") as f:
    seeds, *almanac = f.read().split("\n\n")

seeds = [int(s) for s in re.findall(r"(\d+)", seeds)]

maps = []

for map in almanac:
    map = map.strip().split("\n")[1:]
    map = [[int(s) for s in re.findall(r"(\d+)", line)] for line in map]
    map = [Func(x, x + r - 1, y - x) for y, x, r in map]
    maps.append(map + get_identities(map))

batches = [Batch(s, s + r) for s, r in zip(seeds[::2], seeds[1::2])]

for map in maps:
    mapped = []

    for batch in batches:
        F = [f for f in map if f.start <= batch.end and f.end >= batch.start]

        for f in F:
            start = max(batch.start, f.start) + f.add
            end = min(batch.end, f.end) + f.add
            mapped.append(Batch(start, end))

    batches = mapped

print(min(batch.start for batch in batches))
```
