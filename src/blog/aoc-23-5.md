# AoC 2023: Problem 5

## Part 1

### First draft

My initial solution involved creating an individual function for each map, then
iterating through the individual seeds and applying each function in turn.
Finally, we have the location of each seed. I had stuff like this

```python
for seed in seeds:
  soil = seed_to_soil(seed)
  fertilizer = soil_to_fertilizer(soil)
  # and so on...
```

It worked just fine, but felt too long, and before looking at part two I felt
the need to refactor it: each `x_to_y` is essentially doing the same thing so
can't we somehow automate the creation of the functions?

### Refactor

I ended up with something that felt much better and, crucially, contained some
important ideas for [part 2](#part-2).

```python
answer = float("inf")
for s in seeds:
    for map in maps:
        for y0, x0, r0 in map:
            if x0 <= s < x0 + r0:
                s = y0 + s - x0
                break
    answer = min(s, answer)
```

Apart from parsing the input and printing the output, this is the whole
solution.

Each triple in any given map defines a
[linear function](/pure/coordinate-geometry/equation-of-line/) with gradient $1$
and passing through $(x_0, y_0)$.

So all this solution does is takes a seed, and applies the relevant function
from the next map to the output of the previous one. If any particular input
doesn't fall inside the domain of one of the functions, we just leave it alone.

## Part 2

As most others probably did, I optimistically thought this would be quite easy.
Just apply the previous solution to the new, bigger list of seeds. Simple!

Technically, it works; practically, it doesn't. I left it running for a few
minutes, then cancelled to program to think again.

The idea which works is to notice that it isn't necessary to map each individual
seed. Because each function is linear, if you know what the function does to the
endpoints of its domain, you know what it does to every point in its domain. So
we only need to think about mapping endpoints.

## Visualisation

Let's visualise the batches of seeds lying along a numberline:

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-02.svg)

Then, let's draw around some areas which represent the domains of the functions
in one of the maps:

![numberline with batches and maps](/img/learn/blog-01.svg)

See the area of batch 1 which falls inside the domain of the first function? We
just consider where `f1` would send `batch.start` and `f1.end`. We don't bother
about all the seeds between.

For `f2`, we just consider where it maps `f2.start` and `batch.end`.

For `f3`, it lies entirely inside a batch, so we consider where it sends the
start and end of its domain: `f3.start` and `f3.end`.

Any parts of a batch not inside the domain of some function just get left alone.

## Implementation

### Representing the functions

First, I wanted to find a convenient way to represent each function. The triple
of numbers given is not a convenient representation, so I changed things around:

```python
# we represent each function by the domain it applies to, and
# the amount it adds to the "source" values that live in that interval
map = [{"start": x, "end": x + r - 1, "add": y - x} for y, x, r in map]
```

Now, any seed which lies between `f.start` and `f.end` will be mapped by adding
`f.add` to it. I find this way of thinking to be easier.

### Adding identity functions

For the parts of the numberline which are not covered by any function's domain,
I wanted to have an identity function which simply adds `0` to the seeds. This
makes things easier later on. I'm still deciding on whether this is good or not,
but it does mean when we perform the mapping we have less thinking to do.

```python
# for any values on the numberline not transformed by a function, we add
# an identity function to make life easier later
zero = [
    {"start": float("-inf"), "end": map[0]["start"] - 1, "add": 0},
    {"start": map[-1]["end"], "end": float("inf"), "add": 0},
]

# fill in the gaps
for i in range(1, len(map) - 1):
    right, left = map[i]["end"], map[i + 1]["start"]
    if left - right > 1:
        zero.append({"start": right + 1, "end": left - 1, "add": 0})

map += zero
```

Now, given any input value from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, I can figure out which
domain it lies in and apply the appropriate function from my `map`, even if
that's a function that does nothing.

### Map the endpoints

Given any batch, we need to figure out which functions within the map will
actually affect the batch (i.e. which ones have domains that overlap with the
batch)

```python
# get only the functions which affect the given batch
funcs = [
    f for f in map
    if f["start"] <= batch["end"] and f["end"] >= batch["start"]
]
```

To do the mapping, we need to add `f.add` to each of the relevant endpoints. As
we saw in the visualisation, the way in which the domain overlaps with the batch
matters.

```python
for i in range(len(funcs)):
    f = funcs[i]

    # deal with the overlap with the first function domain
    if i == 0:
        new_batches.append(
            {
                # +f["add"] actually maps the endpoint
                "start": batch["start"] + f["add"],
                # careful in case the domain covers the whole batch:
                "end": min(batch["end"], f["end"]) + f["add"],
            }
        )

    # ...and the overlap for the last function domain
    elif i == len(funcs) - 1:
        new_batches.append(
            {"start": f["start"] + f["add"], "end": batch["end"] + f["add"]}
        )

    # any other functions, their domain is contained entirely
    # inside the batch, so there's less fiddling
    else:
        new_batches.append(
            {"start": f["start"] + f["add"], "end": f["end"] + f["add"]}
        )
```

## Full solution

Here it is. It works. I think it's ugly but understandable.

```python
import re
from time import time

t0 = time()

with open("./input.txt") as f:
    almanac = f.read().strip().split("\n\n")
    seeds = [int(s) for s in re.findall(r"(\d+)", almanac[0])]
    maps = []

    for i in range(1, len(almanac)):
        txt = almanac[i].strip().split("\n")[1:]
        map = [[int(s) for s in re.findall(r"(\d+)", line)] for line in txt]

        # we represent each function by the closed interval it applies to, and
        # the amount it adds to the "source" values that live in that interval
        map = [{"start": x, "end": x + r - 1, "add": y - x} for y, x, r in map]
        map = sorted(map, key=lambda f: f["start"])

        # for any values on the numberline not transformed by a map, we add
        # an identity function to make life easier later
        zero = [
            {"start": float("-inf"), "end": map[0]["start"] - 1, "add": 0},
            {"start": map[-1]["end"], "end": float("inf"), "add": 0},
        ]
        for i in range(1, len(map) - 1):
            right, left = map[i]["end"], map[i + 1]["start"]
            if left - right > 1:
                zero.append({"start": right + 1, "end": left - 1, "add": 0})

        map += zero
        maps.append(map)

# we represent batches of seeds as closed intervals, too
batches = []
for i in range(len(seeds) // 2):
    batches.append({
        "start": seeds[2 * i], "end": seeds[2 * i] + seeds[2 * i + 1]
    })

for map in maps:
    # the maps will be applied to whole batches rather than individual seeds
    # but to do this we only need to consider the endpoints
    new_batches = []
    for batch in batches:
        # get only the functions which affect the given batch
        funcs = [
            f for f in map
            if f["start"] <= batch["end"] and f["end"] >= batch["start"]
        ]
        funcs = sorted(funcs, key=lambda f: f["start"])

        for i in range(len(funcs)):
            f = funcs[i]

            # deal with the overlap with the first function domain
            if i == 0:
                new_batches.append(
                    {
                        "start": batch["start"] + f["add"],
                        "end": min(batch["end"], f["end"]) + f["add"],
                    }
                )

            # ...and the overlap for the last function domain
            elif i == len(funcs) - 1:
                new_batches.append(
                    {
                        "start": f["start"] + f["add"],
                        "end": batch["end"] + f["add"]
                    }
                )

            # any other functions, their domain is contained entirely
            # inside the batch, so there's less fiddling
            else:
                new_batches.append(
                    {
                        "start": f["start"] + f["add"],
                        "end": f["end"] + f["add"]
                    }
                )

        batches = sorted(new_batches, key=lambda b: b["start"])

print(min(batch["start"] for batch in batches))
t1 = time()
print((t1 - t0), "seconds")
```

I would like to refactor at some point to make the code cleaner. But hey, it got
the :white_check_mark:
