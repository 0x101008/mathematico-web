The sequence $v_n$ is defined by
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_1 & = 1 \\
v_{n+1} & = 2 + \frac{q}{v_n}
\end{aligned}
$$
is periodic of period $3$.

Find the value of $q$.

You will need to calculate $v_4$.

It is a good idea to simplify $v_2$ and $v_3$ as you calculate them.

---

Only one of the values you get for $q$ is valid - the other will make a sequence of period $1$.
