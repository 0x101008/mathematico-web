The image below shows the circular segment formed between a circular sector and
a triangle.

Show that, when $\theta$ is small, the area of this segment is approximately
$0.$

The formula for the area of the sector is

$$
\frac{r^2 \theta}{2}
$$

---

Recall that the area of a triangle can be given by

$$
\frac{1}{2} ab \sin C
$$
