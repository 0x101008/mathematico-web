By considering the discriminant of the function
$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (x_i - ty_i)^2
$$
prove the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

---

Since $f(t)$ is a sum of squares, $(x_k - ty_k)^2,$ we must have
$$
f(t) \geq 0
$$

---

This means $f(t)$ has no roots. What does that say about its discriminant?

If you can get $f(t)$ in the form
$$
At^2 + Bt + C
$$
then you can prove the inequality.

Recall the rules of sigma notation:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} c \times u_k + v_k = c \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k
$$
