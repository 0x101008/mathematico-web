Given that $\tan \alpha = \frac{1}{3}$ and $\tan \beta = \frac{2}{3},$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both acute angles, find the value of $\alpha + \beta,$ giving your answer in radians to $3$ significant figures.

Recall the formula
$$
\tan (\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan\alpha\tan\beta}
$$
